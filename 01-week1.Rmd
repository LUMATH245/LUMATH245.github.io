# Introduction to Programming {#intro_prog}

The boss was passing by, so they minimized the browser with the useless Instagram tab and found themselves staring at an Excel window. They had spent hours working on this spreadsheet, crunching pointless numbers and averages. They felt exhausted and bored. They looked at the grid of the spreadsheet, and felt like they were behind the bars of a prison. They wondered if this was what computing was supposed to be like.

They had always loved mathematics once, and wanted to learn how to use it in creative and exciting ways. They wanted to explore new and emerging fields, such as data science, machine learning, AI, cryptography, share their code and results online. Well too late now.

They had never learned how to program, and they felt intimidated and overwhelmed by the complexity and diversity of programming languages and tools. They wished there was a course that could teach them the basics and fundamentals of programming, and show them how to use two of the most popular and powerful languages for scientific computing: R and Python.

Oh, little did they know, that there was such a course: MATH245, Computational Mathematics **and they were enrolled in it?**

## Mathematics and Computing

Welcome to MATH245, Computational Mathematics! In this course, you will learn how to use two of the most popular and powerful programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. You will also learn a bunch of cool algorithms and how to apply them to various mathematical problems.

Why should you learn programming in mathematics? Well, there are many reasons, but few that could be of interest to you are:

1.  This is a mandatory module. You need to learn how to program to pass. Sometimes life is harsh, we know.

2.  Sometimes you will face in computing some problems that are simply too hard to solve by hand. Can't digest that integral? That ODE is beating up your little brother in school for lunch money?\
    *Well, with a computer those will not be a problem anymore.* You will learn how to perform complex and large-scale calculations and simulations that would be impossible or impractical by hand or with a calculator.

3.  Programming is the butter to the bread of these emerging fields of mathematics, such as machine learning, statistical learning, data science and artificial intelligence. Do you want to convert your grandma into a robot? Gottcha, you'll need to know what a neural network is. And likely what stochastic gradient descent is, we will cover that. *Oh, and you need to know how to program.*

4.  Oh, nice Bayesian nested model you got here. It would be a shame if there was not a closed form... What? Your data set has three-thousand features? Well, *modern statistics is done behind a computer.*

In short, programming can make mathematics more fun, more useful, and more relevant to the modern world. As a mathematician in the 21st century, you need to be able to work with a computer and use it as a tool for discovery and innovation.

# Introduction to Computational Mathematics {#intro_prog}

The boss was passing by, so they minimized the browser with the useless Instagram tab and found themselves staring at an Excel window. They had spent hours working on this spreadsheet, crunching pointless numbers and averages. They felt exhausted and bored. They looked at the grid of the spreadsheet, and felt like they were behind the bars of a prison. They wondered if this was what computing was supposed to be like.

They had loved mathematics once, and wanted to learn how to use it in creative and exciting ways. They wanted to explore new and emerging fields, such as data science, machine learning, AI, cryptography, share their code and results online. Well, too late now.

They wished that back in uni there was a course that could teach them the basics and fundamentals of programming, and show them how to use two of the most popular and powerful languages for scientific computing: R and Python.

Oh, what...

Welcome to MATH245, Computational Mathematics! In this course, you will learn how to use two of the most popular and powerful programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. You will also learn a bunch of cool algorithms and how to apply them to various mathematical problems.

Why should you learn programming in mathematics? Well, there are many reasons, but few that could be of interest to you are:

1.  This is a mandatory module. You need to learn how to program to pass. Sometimes life is harsh, we know.

2.  Sometimes you will face in computing some problems that are simply too hard to solve by hand. Can't digest that integral? That ODE is beating up your little brother in school for lunch money?\
    *Well, with a computer those will not be a problem anymore.* You will learn how to perform complex and large-scale calculations and simulations that would be impossible or impractical by hand or with a calculator.

3.  Programming is the butter to the bread of these emerging fields of mathematics, such as machine learning, statistical learning, data science and artificial intelligence. Do you want to convert your grandma into a robot? Gottcha, you'll need to know what a neural network is. And likely what stochastic gradient descent is, we will cover that. *Oh, and you need to know how to program.*

4.  Oh, nice Bayesian nested model you got here. It would be a shame if there was not a closed form... What? Your data set has three-thousand features? Well, *modern statistics is done behind a computer.*

In short, programming can make mathematics more fun, more useful, and more relevant to the modern world. As a mathematician in the 21st century, you need to be able to work with a computer and use it as a tool for discovery and innovation.

And well, don't worry if you have no prior knowledge of programming. We will start from the basics, like really the basics basics, as you can see from the next section header. We will then guide you through the fundamentals and concepts of programming, and then will follow through the basics of Computational Mathematics and Algorithms. We will also give you plenty of examples and exercises to practice and test your skills. By the end of this course, you will be able to write and run your own code in both R and Python, which are two of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing, and learn very useful algorithms that you will apply to various mathematical problems.

## What is a Computer?

Few years ago Apple came up with yet another iPad. And with that, another of their ads. In that one a kid would do a bunch of things around with an iPad pro, kinda like working on Word or drawing silly things. Then, at the end, a peeping neighbor, perhaps too curious, would ask them: *"Wattcha doing on your computer?"*. To which the kid, holding the iPad, replies: *"What's a computer?"*. Here, look for yourself:

Well, you silly! Your iPad is a computer. So it's your smartphone. And your smartwatch, probably your TV, your Fridge and your car - if you have a fancy electric car. We're living in a world of computers.

There are many kinds of computers, but you have probably interacted mostly with smartphones and desktop or laptop computers. As a student of in this module, you will likely use a desktop (the university machine) or your own laptop for programming. Theoretically, however, you can also program on other devices, such as tablets (or smartwatches, even!), obviously with some caveats and limitations.\
Also, computers will have different architectures, such as x86, ARM, or RISC-V, that determine how they processes the instructions and data. You might not know it, but your laptop could have a mobile processor, like the such as Snapdragon, Exynos, or Apple M-series. **This could impact your learning experience in this module, so, if you are not familiar with the concept above stick to the university machines.**

More formally, a computer is a device that can perform calculations and manipulate data, all by following a set of instructions known as a program. It has the ability to process a variety of data types, including numbers, text, images, sound, and video, and can produce a range of outputs. This could be anything from displaying information on a screen, playing audio, or transmitting information over the internet (which, in its simplest form, is just two computers exchanging text).

Let\'s delve a bit deeper into the main components of a computer:

1.  **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Often referred to as the \'brain\' of the computer, the CPU is responsible for executing the program\'s instructions.

2.  **Memory**: This is the computer\'s short-term memory, sometimes known as **RAM (Random Access Memory)**. It stores the data that the CPU needs to access quickly and frequently. RAM is volatile, which means that its contents are lost when the computer is turned off or restarted.

3.  **Storage**: This is the computer\'s long-term memory. It holds data that isn\'t required immediately or frequently by the CPU. This could include the program itself or files created by the user. Hard drives are non-volatile, meaning their contents persist even when the computer is turned off.

To illustrate how these components interact, let\'s consider what happens when you run a program e.g. a series of instruction that make sense to your CPU:

Say that your program and your data are saved on your hard drive (a type of storage). The program, along with any necessary data, is then loaded from the hard drive into the memory. This allows the CPU to access it. The CPU then carries out the program\'s instructions, performing calculations and operations on the data stored in the memory. The results of these operations remain in the memory and can be displayed on the screen, saved back to the hard drive, or sent to another device. This process highlights the integral role each component plays in the functioning of a computer.

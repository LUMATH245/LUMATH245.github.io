### Exercise: ggplots of periodic functions

In this exercises we will be plotting few sine and cosine waves. This should combine 
both knowledge of creating a data frame, and ggplot.
The exercise has two levels of completition, a basic level where we will be plotting a sine function 
from 1 to 10, and an advance level where we will be displaying multiple periodic functions.

**Basic.** Via ggplot, plot a sinusoidal function, $y = \sin(x)$, from 0 to 10:
1.    You want to create a sequence of numbers, `x`, of at least 100 values ranging from 0 to 10.
2.    You then want to run the sine function on this sequence to get the `y`
3.    Store the results of this operation in a data frame
4.    Plot using ggplot's `geom_line()`. Add labels! 

**Advanced.** Using `ggplot`, write a program that returns a plot with three facets (subplots). Each facet will be comparing sines and cosines with different frequencies.
- The x-axis should range from 0 to 10, with a step size of 0.01.
- The plot should show 6 superimposed sinusoidal functions: $$\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right), \sin(x), \sin(2x), \cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right), \cos(x), \cos(2x)$$.
- The plot should have three facets, one for each frequency ($\frac{1}{2}$, 1, and 2). Each facet should contain both the sine and cosine functions of that frequency.
- Use different colours for each curve within the facets. The functions $$\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right), \sin(x), \sin(2x)$$ should share the same colour, and the functions $$\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right), \cos(x), \cos(2x)$$ should share a different colour.
- Make sure that the facets are aligned along the x-axis.
- Avoid a `for` loop or computing everything by hand. Use `map` and `functools.reduce` to generate the dataframes and combine them. Use lambda functions where necessary.

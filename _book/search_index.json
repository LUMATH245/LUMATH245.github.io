They had spent hours working on this spreadsheet, crunching pointless numbers and averages. They felt exhausted and bored. They looked at the grid of the spreadsheet, and felt like they were behind the bars of a prison. They wondered if this was what computing was supposed to be like. They had always loved mathematics once, and wanted to learn how to use it in creative and exciting ways. They wanted to explore new and emerging fields, such as data science, machine learning, AI, cryptography, share their code and results online. Well too late now. They had never learned how to program, and they felt intimidated and overwhelmed by the complexity and diversity of programming languages and tools. They wished there was a course that could teach them the basics and fundamentals of programming, and show them how to use two of the most popular and powerful languages for scientific computing: R and Python. Oh, little did they know, that there was such a course: MATH245, Computational Mathematics and they were enrolled in it? Welcome to MATH245, Computational Mathematics! In this course, you will learn how to use two of the most popular and powerful programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. You will also learn a bunch of cool algorithms and how to apply them to various mathematical problems. Why should you learn programming in mathematics? Well, there are many reasons, but few that could be of interest to you are: This is a mandatory module. You need to learn how to program to pass. Sometimes life is harsh, we know. Sometimes you will face in computing some problems that are simply too hard to solve by hand. Can’t digest that integral? That ODE is beating up your little brother in school for lunch money? Well, with a computer those will not be a problem anymore. You will learn how to perform complex and large-scale calculations and simulations that would be impossible or impractical by hand or with a calculator. Programming is the butter to the bread of these emerging fields of mathematics, such as machine learning, statistical learning, data science and artificial intelligence. Do you want to convert your grandma into a robot? Gottcha, you’ll need to know what a neural network is. And likely what stochastic gradient descent is, we will cover that. Oh, and you need to know how to program. Oh, nice Bayesian nested model you got here. It would be a shame if there was not a closed form… What? Your data set has three-thousand features? Well, modern statistics is done behind a computer. In short, programming can make mathematics more fun, more useful, and more relevant to the modern world. As a mathematician in the 21st century, you need to be able to work with a computer and use it as a tool for discovery and innovation. And well, don’t worry if you have no prior knowledge of programming. We will start from the basics, like really the basics basics, as you can see from the next section header. We will then guide you through the fundamentals and concepts of programming, and then will follow through the basics of Computational Mathematics and Algorithms. We will also give you plenty of examples and exercises to practice and test your skills. By the end of this course, you will be able to write and run your own code in both R and Python, which are two of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing, and learn very useful algorithms that you will apply to various mathematical problems. 1.1 What is a Computer? Few years ago Apple came up with yet another iPad. And with that, another of their ads. In that one a kid would do a bunch of things around with an iPad pro, kinda like working on Word or drawing silly things. Then, at the end, a peeping neighbor, perhaps too curious, would ask them in a tick new your accent: “Wattcha doing on your computer?”. To which the kid, holding the iPad, replies: “What’s a computer?”. Here, look for yourself: Well, you silly! Your iPad is a computer. So it’s your smartphone. And your smartwatch, probably your TV, your Fridge and your car - if you have a fancy electric car. We’re living in a world of computers. But more formally, a computer is… "],["chapter2.html", "2 test2", " 2 test2 test2 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

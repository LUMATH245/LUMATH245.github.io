They had spent hours working on this spreadsheet, crunching pointless numbers and averages. They felt exhausted and bored. They looked at the grid of the spreadsheet, and felt like they were behind the bars of a prison. They wondered if this was what computing was supposed to be like. They had loved mathematics once, and wanted to learn how to use it in creative and exciting ways. They wanted to explore new and emerging fields, such as data science, machine learning, AI, cryptography, share their code and results online. Well, too late now. They wished that back in uni there was a course that could teach them the basics and fundamentals of programming, and show them how to use two of the most popular and powerful languages for scientific computing: R and Python. Oh, what… Welcome to MATH245, Computational Mathematics! In this course, you will learn how to use two of the most popular and powerful programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. You will also learn a bunch of cool algorithms and how to apply them to various mathematical problems. Why should you learn programming in mathematics? Well, there are many reasons, but few that could be of interest to you are: This is a mandatory module. You need to learn how to program to pass. Sometimes life is harsh, we know. Sometimes you will face in computing some problems that are simply too hard to solve by hand. Can’t digest that integral? That ODE is beating up your little brother in school for lunch money? Well, with a computer those will not be a problem anymore. You will learn how to perform complex and large-scale calculations and simulations that would be impossible or impractical by hand or with a calculator. Programming is the butter to the bread of these emerging fields of mathematics, such as machine learning, statistical learning, data science and artificial intelligence. Do you want to convert your grandma into a robot? Gottcha, you’ll need to know what a neural network is. And likely what stochastic gradient descent is, we will cover that. Oh, and you need to know how to program. Oh, nice Bayesian nested model you got here. It would be a shame if there was not a closed form… What? Your data set has three-thousand features? Well, modern statistics is done behind a computer. In short, programming can make mathematics more fun, more useful, and more relevant to the modern world. As a mathematician in the 21st century, you need to be able to work with a computer and use it as a tool for discovery and innovation. And well, don’t worry if you have no prior knowledge of programming. We will start from the basics, like really the basics basics, as you can see from the next section header. We will then guide you through the fundamentals and concepts of programming, and then will follow through the basics of Computational Mathematics and Algorithms. We will also give you plenty of examples and exercises to practice and test your skills. By the end of this course, you will be able to write and run your own code in both R and Python, which are two of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing, and learn very useful algorithms that you will apply to various mathematical problems. 1.1 What is a Computer? Few years ago Apple came up with yet another iPad. And with that, another one of their ads. In one specifically, a kid would do a bunch of things with an iPad pro, like working on Word, reading comics or drawing silly things. Then, at the end, a peeping neighbor, perhaps too curious, would ask them: “Wattcha doing on your computer?”. To which the kid, holding the iPad, replies: “What’s a computer?”. Here, look for yourself: Well, you silly! Your iPad is a computer. So it’s your smartphone. And your smartwatch, probably your TV, your Fridge and your car - if you have a fancy electric car. We’re living in a world of computers. There are many kinds of computers, but you have probably interacted mostly with smartphones and desktop or laptop computers. As a student of in this module, you will likely use a desktop (the university machine) or your own laptop for programming. Theoretically, however, you can also program on other devices, such as tablets (or smartwatches, even!), obviously with some caveats and limitations. Also, computers will have different architectures, such as x86, ARM, or RISC-V, that determine how they processes the instructions and data. You might not know it, but your laptop could have a mobile processor, like the such as Snapdragon, Exynos, or Apple M-series. This could impact your learning experience in this module, so, if you are not familiar with the concept above stick to the university machines. More formally, a computer is a device that can perform calculations and manipulate data, all by following a set of instructions known as a program. It has the ability to process a variety of data types, including numbers, text, images, sound, and video, and can produce a range of outputs. This could be anything from displaying information on a screen, playing audio, or transmitting information over the internet (which, in its simplest form, is just two computers exchanging text). Let’s delve a bit deeper into the main components of a computer: Central Processing Unit (CPU): Often referred to as the ‘brain’ of the computer, the CPU is responsible for executing the program’s instructions. Memory: This is the computer’s short-term memory, sometimes known as RAM (Random Access Memory). It stores the data that the CPU needs to access quickly and frequently. RAM is volatile, which means that its contents are lost when the computer is turned off or restarted. Storage: This is the computer’s long-term memory. It holds data that isn’t required immediately or frequently by the CPU. This could include the program itself or files created by the user. Hard drives are non-volatile, meaning their contents persist even when the computer is turned off. To illustrate how these components interact, let’s consider what happens when you run a program e.g. a series of instruction that make sense to your CPU: Say that your program and your data are saved on your hard drive (a type of storage). The program, along with any necessary data, is then loaded from the hard drive into the memory. This allows the CPU to access it. The CPU then carries out the program’s instructions, performing calculations and operations on the data stored in the memory. The results of these operations remain in the memory and can be displayed on the screen, saved back to the hard drive, or sent to another device. This process highlights the integral role each component plays in the functioning of a computer. 1.1.1 Computer Programs and Programming Languages We have mentioned a program earlier, but what is a program? A program is a sequence of instructions that tells the computer what to do. A program can be written in different ways, depending on the level of abstraction and the intended audience. For example, a program can be written in natural language, such as English, or in a formal language, such as mathematics. However, the computer cannot understand these languages directly. It can only understand a very low-level language, called machine code, which consists of binary digits (0s and 1s) that represent the basic operations of the CPU. We call this set of binary instructions a computer program. Therefore, to make the computer execute a program, we need to translate it from a higher-level language to a lower-level language. This is where programming languages come in. A programming language is a formal language that defines the syntax and semantics of a program. A programming language allows us to write programs in a more human-readable and expressive way, and then, as an interpreter, translate them to machine code that the computer can understand and execute. There are many programming languages, and they have different features and purposes. Some programming languages are designed for specific domains or tasks, such as web development, data analysis, or game design, whilst others are more general-purpose and can be used for a variety of applications. In this course, we will focus on two of the most popular and versatile programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. Both of these languages are high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose languages: High-level means that the programming language is closer to natural language and more abstracted from the details of the machine code. This makes the language easier to read, write, and understand, but also requires more translation and processing by the interpreter or the compiler. But don’t worry about this… Fortunately most of the heavy lifting is done by the compiler, which is the interpreter that converts the code from human readable to machine readable. Interpreted means that the programming language does not need to be compiled before execution, but rather is translated and executed line by line by a program called an interpreter. This allows the language to be more dynamic and flexible, but also slower and less efficient than compiled languages. One of the advantages of interpreted languages is that you can execute commands directly in the console, in addition to writing and saving these in a script. This is useful for testing and debugging your code, or for performing quick calculations and operations. General-purpose means that the programming language can be used for a variety of applications and domains, and is not limited to a specific purpose or task. This makes the language more versatile and adaptable, but also less specialized and optimized than domain-specific languages. General-purpose languages can be used for web development, video game engineering, automation, and… Scientific computing, among other things. 1.1.2 R and Python Well, finally it’s time to introduce our two friends. And as with any good introduction, we give a bit of history. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in 1993. It is based on the S language, which was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and others in the 1970s. R is free and open source, and has a large and active community of users and developers. R is especially popular among statisticians, data scientists, and researchers in various fields. Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It was created by Max Verstappen in the Netherlands 5 years ago. Nah, just kidding… It was made though in the Netherlands in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI). It is named after the comedy group Monty Python, and has a philosophy of simplicity, readability, and elegance. Python is also free and open source, and has a huge and diverse community of users and developers. Python is widely used for a variety of tasks and it’s getting more and more popular in statistics and for scientific computing. Both R and Python have many advantages and features that make them suitable for mathematical applications, such as: They are easy to learn and use, with clear and consistent syntax and semantics. They allow you to write concise and elegant code that can handle complex problems, without getting too lost in complicated syntax (have a look at some C or Fortran code for instance). They are extensible and modular, supporting multiple paradigms and styles of programming, such as functional, object-oriented, and procedural. For this course, we will be focusing on functional programming. This will come later, as it’s the a way of programming that is really close with mathematics. They have rich and comprehensive libraries and packages that provide a wide range of functions and tools for various domains and tasks, such as linear algebra, optimization, machine learning, visualization, and web scraping. They have interactive and user-friendly environments and interfaces that facilitate development and debugging, such as the console, the editor, and the notebook. We will be using, for this module R studio. 1.2 Computing, Accessing Memory and Storing We covered the three components of the computer: the CPU, the memory and the storage. Well, a programming language is a powerful tool that allows to build a set of instructions that use all these three components. By the end of this chapter, we won’t be able to write a full program yet, but hopefully we will show how these three interact. Before we proceed, a quick rundown on how to read the lines of code in these notes. Every once in a while you will see a chunk of code, and sometimes a result of what the chunk of code does. For example: # Hi, I am a chunk of R code that prints to output &quot;Beep bop beep&quot; print(&quot;Beep bop beep&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Beep bop beep&quot; As the comment (that bit in gray that starts with the #), suggests, what you saw is a chunk of R code that prints to output the text “Beep bop beep”. On top you will find the code, and on the bottom the result, i.e. the output. The comment does not get executed, so it’s just an explanation of what you are seeing. The actual code statement, print(\"Beep bop beep\"), is the one that does all the job, and, as the comments sugests, prints the text “Beep bop beep”. Wait, but I thought we would have learned Python in this module? Well, patience, my dear friend (btw, we are not friends). The python equivalent of that statement would be: # Hi, I am a chunk of Python code that prints to output &quot;Beep bop beep&quot; print(&quot;Beep bop beep&quot;) ## Beep bop beep Wait, they’re basically the same? Well, yes, that’s the point, and the reason why we teach them both simultaneously. Despite the culture war that there’s currently in Statistics and Data Science, we believe that there’s no such thing as a best programming language: the expert worker should use all tools available at this hand. R and Python, for scientific computing, are almost equivalent at this day, and given recent developments, they can work together. For your project you will have to pick either one, or the other, but if you are confident enough, feel to learn both, you’re more then welcome. As a matter of fact, for all the these notes, we will always try to have them both side to side. On the left you will always an R code chunk, and on the right you will find the Python equivalent: R print(&quot;R chunk on the left.&quot;) ## [1] &quot;R chunk on the left.&quot; python print(&quot;Python chunk on the right.&quot;) ## Python chunk on the right. If for formatting reasons we won’t be able to show the code side to side, you can always tell which is which by the bold text immediately above the chunk, e.g. R or python. Anyway, how did we made such a fancy set of lecture notes? Through Rmarkdown using Rstudio. Don’t worry, we will learn about these two tools later. Another cool thing you can do with a computer. 1.2.1 A glorified calculator That’s it, the CPU. End of the Section. The CPU is a glorified calculator, nothing more to it. Imagine all these looser that get excited at those numbers, like i7, i5, A4, Pentium 5, Neural Pre-processor, Snapdragon, Qbits, SmartBpprop, Bombastic, Mr fantastic, etc. Get a life, touch grass. Anyway. Open up the console. Either the R or Python one. And copy and paste the following code snippets into it. Then, press enter, you will see the result. This is how we do additions: R 3 + 5 ## [1] 8 python 3 + 5 ## 8 The result is automatically printed back to the user. Now, this is how we do subtractions: R 3 - 5 ## [1] -2 python 3 - 5 ## -2 And this is how we do additions and subtractions, and multiplications, and algebra in general: R 3 + 5 * 2 ## [1] 13 python 3 + 5 * 2 ## 13 The order of the operations comes from algebra, so in that snippet, we will first have 5 * 2, that gives us 10, and then we will do 3 + 10. Of course we can do much more then simple additions of subtractions and multiplications. Here I have a list of basic operations we can do with both the languages. Note that the syntax will not always be the same: Operation R Example Python Example Add 2 + 3 2 + 3 Subtract 2 - 3 2 - 3 Multiply 2 * 3 2 * 3 Divide 2 / 3 2 / 3 Modulus 2 %% 3 2 % 3 Square root sqrt(2) math.sqrt(2) Power 2^3 2 ** 3 Cosine cos(2 * pi) math.cos(2 * math.pi) Sine sin(pi / 2) math.sin(math.pi / 2) Tangent tan(pi / 4) math.tan(math.pi / 4) Natural log log(2) math.log(2) Expontential exp(2) math.exp(2) Please note that in Python, you need to import the math module to use mathematical functions like sqrt, cos, sin, tan, log, and exp. Also, pi is accessed as math.pi in Python. At the start of your python script, just add the following: Python import math Don’t worry too much about this for now. 1.2.1.1 Exercise Using numbers of your own, try the other basic mathematical operations listed below. Split a £10 bill across 3 people, check if 91 is a prime number using the modulus with the first 5 primes or get the Euler number. Play around, be wild. 1.2.1.2 Putting an order to operations Once you’re happy, try stringing some of these calculations all into one command, for example: R 3 + 7 * 5 / 3 - 2 ## [1] 12.66667 (3 + 7) * 5 / (3 - 2) ## [1] 50 Python 3 + 7 * 5 / 3 - 2 ## 12.666666666666666 (3 + 7) * 5 / (3 - 2) ## 50.0 The multiplication and division calculations are performed first (* and /), followed by addition and subtraction (+ and -), going from left to right. You may remember this from School as BODMAS: Brackets, Orders (powers, square roots), Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction This can be overridden by using putting the calculations we want to perform first in brackets. For instance, there’s this formula that has been really bothering me. It popped up this morning at 4am, and kept me awake. What is the square root of three fourth, over a third minus 2 divided by pi square? A hunted seagull of chalk flying around the vast sea of obsidian that is the blackboard of my mind, over and over and over again: \\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{3/4}}{\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{\\pi^2}}. \\] Here you go, be free, little bird: R sqrt(3 / 4) / (1 / 3 - 2 / pi^2) ## [1] 6.626513 Python math.sqrt(3 / 4) / (1 / 3 - 2 / math.pi**2) ## 6.626513139875386 1.2.2 What if calculators could remember? Yeah, what if? Well, that’s what the memory is for, keeping things in mind. You can think of the memory as a bookshelf, filled with boxes. Or if you’re one fan of that Henry Popper, the Magician Kid of Hogtwarz, (I do not wish to pay for the rights to Warner Bros) it’s like that room filled with shelves and bottles of thoughts and spells. Yes, that’s a better image. So the CPU is the Ministerium of Evil Magicians can access each shelf whenever it feels or needs. Now, in a computer, of course, instead of bottles, you have areas of the memory, and instead of spells, you have numbers, or vectors, or strings (text, e.g. a series of characters). Now the Ministerium, to access the spells and the thoughts in the bottles, has a bunch of Evil Magicians, that walk in the archive, and that can claim these bottles by putting labels onto them. Those magicians are, in the computer, our programs. Putting a label on an area of memory is called creating a variable. Now, here’s the thing: when a magician grabs a bottle, they can either look at which thought or spell is in it, or put a new thought into it. An existing thought in a bottle cannot be modified. If they wish to keep the same bottle with the same label, but change the content, they open it, get rid of the old content, and simply put a new one. Now, to give an example, Prof. Sinsinius Snap, to kill that guy that kinda of looks like Gandalf, needs to store two spells. In one he needs to store the formula of the spell that causes the victim to feel a lot of pain (this was in a children book, by the way), and in the other, the formula that makes the heart’s victim stop. To do so, it cretes two labels, spell_to_torture and spell_to_kill, so it won’t loose the bottles in the archive,and in each it puts the evil spell: R spell_to_torture &lt;- &quot;porcosus&quot; spell_to_kill &lt;- &quot;avada kebaba&quot; python spell_to_torture = &quot;porcosus&quot; spell_to_kill = &quot;avada kebaba&quot; What did we do? We assigned two strings, \"porcosus\" and \"avada kebaba\", indicative of our spells, in two variables, called spell_to_torture and spell_to_kill (the labels). You can read the code above as assign “porcosus” to spell_to_torture, and assign “avada kebaba” to spell_to_kill. This can be done with the &lt;- sign in R and with the = sign in Python. What we did reserved an area of memory where now our two strings are stored and are accessible to our program. Now, our dear Prof. Sinsinius Snap, to access the spells again, all he needs to do, is to recall the labels he used, e.g. the variable names, and the archive will remind him of the content of the bottles: R spell_to_torture ## [1] &quot;porcosus&quot; spell_to_kill ## [1] &quot;avada kebaba&quot; python spell_to_torture ## &#39;porcosus&#39; spell_to_kill ## &#39;avada kebaba&#39; Ouch! He realizes he putted the wrong spell in the spell_to_torture bottle. Well, no problem, as mentioned above, he can re-bottle the correct one. To do so, he simply reassigns the correct spell \"cruccio\" to the bottle labelled spell_to_torture: R spell_to_torture &lt;- &quot;cruccio&quot; python spell_to_torture = &quot;cruccio&quot; Note that now, the old spell \"porcosus\" is lost. In fact, when he looks at the spell_to_torture bottle, he sees: R spell_to_torture ## [1] &quot;cruccio&quot; python spell_to_torture ## &#39;cruccio&#39; “Well done Sinsinius!” he says, patting himself on the shoulder. 1.2.2.1 Doing maths with variables Now of course, this is a university, not a school of magic and divination, so we ultimately need to do some maths. In programming, we often need to store the results of our calculations for later use. This is where variables come in handy. We mentioned you can think of a variable as a bottle where you can store a value. You can give this bottle a label (a name), and use this label to refer to the bottled value later on. For example, let’s say we want to perform some calculations: R x &lt;- 20 - 16 y &lt;- 4 + 5 x - y ## [1] -5 Python x = 20 - 16 y = 4 + 5 x - y ## -5 Here, x and y are variables. We’ve assigned them the results of some calculations. Now, whenever we refer to x or y, we’re actually referring to the results of these calculations. We can check the values stored in x and y by simply typing their names: R x ## [1] 4 y ## [1] 9 Python x ## 4 y ## 9 Remember, R and Python are case-sensitive, so x is different from X. If you try to access X, you’ll get an error because we haven’t assigned anything to X: R X ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;X&#39; not found Python X ## name &#39;X&#39; is not defined Also, if you assign a new value to a variable, the old value will be overwritten without any warning: R x &lt;- -100 x ## [1] -100 Python x = -100 x ## -100 Now, here’s something cool. In maths, an equation like \\(x = x + 1\\) doesn’t make much sense. But in programming, it’s perfectly valid. It means “take the current value of x, add 1 to it, and store the result back in x”. This is a common way to increment a variable: R x &lt;- x + 1 x ## [1] -99 Python x = x + 1 x ## -99 In fact, you can use all mathematical operations in this way. You should use variables as much as you can to keep the code as clean and readable as possible. Let’s revisit the example above: R numerator &lt;- sqrt(3 / 4) denominator &lt;- (1 / 3 - 2 / pi^2) result &lt;- numerator / denominator result ## [1] 6.626513 Python numerator = math.sqrt(3 / 4) denominator = (1 / 3 - 2 / math.pi**2) result = numerator / denominator result ## 6.626513139875386 In this refactored code, we first calculate the numerator and the denominator separately and store them in variables. Then, we perform the division operation and store the result in another variable. This makes the code easier to read and understand. It also allows us to reuse the numerator and denominator calculations if needed elsewhere in the code. This is a good practice in programming. It not only makes the code cleaner but also more efficient. 1.2.3 Storing Data on the Hard Drive When you’re working with a programming language like R or Python, any variables you create are stored in your computer’s memory (the RAM). This is a type of storage that’s fast and easy for your computer to access, which is why it’s used for tasks that are currently running. However, memory is volatile, which means that once the power is turned off or your program finishes running, any data stored in memory is lost. Sometimes, you might want your program to produce something tangible that doesn’t get lost when the power is turned off or your program stops running. This could be a report, a graph, or even just a set of numbers. To do this, you can write this data to a file on your hard drive. Unlike memory, data stored on your hard drive remains there until it’s deleted, so you can access it again later. Let’s look at how you can write data to a file in R and Python. R # Create some data data &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Write the data to a file write.csv(data, file = &quot;data.csv&quot;) Python # Import the pandas library import pandas as pd # Create some data data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Convert the data to a DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Write the data to a file df.to_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;, index=False) In both of these examples, we’re creating a set of data (the numbers 1 through 5), and then writing this data to a file called “data.csv”. The write.csv function in R and the to_csv function in Python are used to write the data to a file. In R, when you see c(1, 2, 3), we’re making a vector. As in maths, this is a collection of numbers that you’ve bundled together in a specific order: first 1, then 2, then 3. In Python, when you see [1, 2, 3], it’s very similar. This in python is called a list. We’ll learn more about these collections (vectors in R and lists in Python) next week. For now, just remember that they are a way to keep your items organized and in a specific order. It’s like having a container where you can keep your things neatly instead of having them scattered all over the place. This makes it easier to find what you need later on. Moreover, in the Python example, you might have noticed the pd.DataFrame statement. This is a way to create a DataFrame, which is a kind of table, using the pandas library. Again, don’t worry! We’ll cover these topics in more detail later on. For now, just know that we’re using a DataFrame to store our data in a structured way that can be easily written to a file. Now, let’s talk about CSV files. CSV stands for “Comma-Separated Values”. It’s a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line of the file is a data record, and each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. This is why it’s called a “comma-separated values” file. When we write our data to a CSV file, each item of data goes into its own field, and each set of data (like a row from a table) goes into its own record. This makes CSV files a great way to store tabular data, because it’s easy to input the data into a spreadsheet or database program later on. I encourage you to open the “data.csv” file we created in a text editor or spreadsheet program. You’ll see that the data is stored in a structured, easy-to-read format. Each number is in its own field, and each set of numbers is in its own record. Remember, storing data on your hard drive is a great way to preserve your data for later use. It’s also a great way to share your data with others, or to move your data between different programs. So don’t be afraid to use file input and output in your own programs. It’s a powerful tool that can help you do more with your data. Happy coding! 😊 1.2.3.1 Reading back your data Now, let’s say we want to access this data at a later time. We can do this by reading the file back into our program. Here’s how you can do it in R and Python: R # Read the data from the file data_from_file &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;) # Print the data print(data_from_file) ## X0 ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 ## 5 5 Python # Read the data from the file data_from_file = pd.read_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;) # Print the data print(data_from_file) ## 0 ## 0 1 ## 1 2 ## 2 3 ## 3 4 ## 4 5 In both of these examples, we’re using the read.csv function in R and the read_csv function in Python to read the data from the file back into our program. When we print this data, we can see that it’s the same as the data we originally wrote to the file. This is a basic introduction to storing data on your hard drive using R and Python. There’s a lot more you can do with file input and output, but this should give you a good starting point. Remember, the key is to use variables to store your data in memory while your program is running, and then write this data to a file on your hard drive if you want to keep it for later.

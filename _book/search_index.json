They were written by Gaetano Romano (Chapter 1-5) and Eduard Campillo-Funollet (Chapters 6-10). The module will introduce you to scientific computing (with a bit of functional programming), and algorithms. The first 5 Chapters will be focusing on scientific computing. Specifically, we’ll cover: Intro to computing, variables and saving to file Logic and Vectors Functions and Loops Maps and Linear Algebra Data Frames and Plotting Chapters 6 to 10 will be focusing on algorithms. We’ll cover: Fixed Points Root finding Gradient Descent Monte Carlo and Integration ODEs solvers All contents are still subject to change. The notes are both in Python and R. You are expected to only learn one programming language. However, these notes could be used also as a reference to go from one language to the other! Please access them from a wide screen machine, as they were not optimized for mobile. Every week, you are expected to follow one lecture and one lab. Over the lecture, an overview of the contents of the week will be given. But during the lab, you should give it a go at the notes at your own pace, and follow the contents by copy and pasting commands from the notes onto your pc, and completing the exercises. Solutions to the exercises will be uploaded on Moodle after all labs of the week end.

They had spent hours working on this spreadsheet, crunching pointless numbers and averages. They felt exhausted and bored. They looked at the grid of the spreadsheet, and felt like they were behind the bars of a prison. They wondered if this was what computing was supposed to be like. They had loved mathematics once, and wanted to learn how to use it in creative and exciting ways. They wanted to explore new and emerging fields, such as data science, machine learning, AI, cryptography and to share their code and results online. Well, too late now. They wished that back in uni there was a course that could teach them the basics and fundamentals of programming, and show them how to use two of the most popular and powerful languages for scientific computing: R and Python. Oh, what… Welcome to MATH245, Computational Mathematics! In this course, you will learn how to use two of the most popular and powerful programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. You will also learn a bunch of cool algorithms and how to apply them to various mathematical problems. Why should you learn programming in mathematics? Well, there are many reasons, but a few that could be of interest to you are: This is a mandatory module. You need to learn how to program to pass. Sometimes life is harsh, we know. Sometimes you fill face problems that are simply too hard to solve by hand. Can’t digest that integral? That ODE is beating up your little brother in school for lunch money? Well, with a computer those will not be a problem anymore. You will learn how to perform complex and large-scale calculations and simulations that would be impossible or impractical by hand or with a calculator. Programming is the butter to the bread of emerging fields of mathematics such as, machine learning, statistical learning, data science and artificial intelligence. Do you want to convert your grandma into a robot? Gottcha, you’ll need to know what a neural network is. And likely what stochastic gradient descent is, we will cover that. Oh, and you need to know how to program. Ooh, nice statistical model for Covid-19 modelling you’ve got there. It would be a shame if there was not a closed form… What? Your data set has three-thousand features? Well, modern statistics is done behind a computer, in R or Python or (if you choose) both. In short, programming can make mathematics more fun, more useful, and more relevant to the modern world. As a mathematician in the 21st century, you need to be able to work with a computer and use it as a tool for discovery and innovation. And well, don’t worry if you have no prior knowledge of programming. We will start from the basics, like really the basics basics, as you can see from the next section header. We will then guide you through the fundamentals and concepts of programming, and then will follow through the basics of Computational Mathematics and Algorithms. We will also give you plenty of examples and exercises to practice and test your skills. By the end of this course, you will be able to write and run your own code in both R and Python, which are two of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing, and learn very useful algorithms that you will apply to various mathematical problems. 1.1 What is a Computer? Few years ago Apple came up with yet another iPad. And with that, another one of their ads. In one specifically, a kid would do a bunch of things with an iPad pro, like working on Word, reading comics or drawing silly things. Then, at the end, a peeping neighbor, perhaps too curious, would ask them: “Wattcha doing on your computer?”. To which the kid, holding the iPad, replies: “What’s a computer?”. Here, look for yourself: Well, you silly! Your iPad is a computer. So it’s your smartphone. And your smartwatch, probably your TV, your Fridge and your car - if you have a fancy electric car. We’re living in a world of computers. There are many kinds of computers, but you have probably interacted mostly with smartphones and desktop or laptop computers. As a student of in this module, you will likely use a desktop (the university machine) or your own laptop for programming. Theoretically, however, you can also program on other devices, such as tablets (or smartwatches, even!), obviously with some caveats and limitations. Also, computers will have different architectures, such as x86, ARM, or RISC-V, that determine how they processes the instructions and data. You might not know it, but your laptop could have a mobile processor, like the such as Snapdragon, Exynos, or Apple M-series. This could impact your learning experience in this module, so, if you are not familiar with the concept above stick to the university machines. More formally, a computer is a device that can perform calculations and manipulate data, all by following a set of instructions known as a program. It has the ability to process a variety of data types, including numbers, text, images, sound, and video, and can produce a range of outputs. This could be anything from displaying information on a screen, playing audio, or transmitting information over the internet (which, in its simplest form, is just two computers exchanging text). Let’s delve a bit deeper into the main components of a computer: Central Processing Unit (CPU): Often referred to as the ‘brain’ of the computer, the CPU is responsible for executing the program’s instructions. Memory: This is the computer’s short-term memory, sometimes known as RAM (Random Access Memory). It stores the data that the CPU needs to access quickly and frequently. RAM is volatile, which means that its contents are lost when the computer is turned off or restarted. Storage: This is the computer’s long-term memory. It holds data that isn’t required immediately or frequently by the CPU. This could include the program itself or files created by the user. Hard drives are non-volatile, meaning their contents persist even when the computer is turned off. To illustrate how these components interact, let’s consider what happens when you run a program e.g. a series of instruction that make sense to your CPU: Say that your program and your data are saved on your hard drive (a type of storage). The program, along with any necessary data, is then loaded from the hard drive into the memory. This allows the CPU to access it. The CPU then carries out the program’s instructions, performing calculations and operations on the data stored in the memory. The results of these operations remain in the memory and can be displayed on the screen, saved back to the hard drive, or sent to another device. This process highlights the integral role each component plays in the functioning of a computer. 1.1.1 Computer Programs and Programming Languages We have mentioned a program earlier, but what is a program? A program is a sequence of instructions that tells the computer what to do. A program can be written in different ways, depending on the level of abstraction and the intended audience. For example, a program can be written in natural language, such as English, or in a formal language, such as mathematics. However, the computer cannot understand these languages directly. It can only understand a very low-level language, called machine code, which consists of binary digits (0s and 1s) that represent the basic operations of the CPU. Something that is ultimately rendered into a set of binary instructions to feed to the CPU is a computer program. Therefore, to make the computer execute a program, we need to translate it from a higher-level language to a lower-level language. This is where programming languages come in. A programming language is a formal language that defines the syntax and semantics of a program. A programming language allows us to write programs in a more human-readable and expressive way. Then another computer program (called interpreter), translate our programs to machine code that the computer can understand and execute. There are many programming languages, and they have different features and purposes. Some programming languages are designed for specific domains or tasks, such as web development, data analysis, or game design, whilst others are more general-purpose and can be used for a variety of applications. In this course, we will focus on two of the most popular and versatile programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. Both of these languages are high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose languages: High-level means that the programming language is closer to natural language and more abstracted from the details of the machine code. This makes the language easier to read, write, and understand, but also requires more translation and processing by the interpreter or the compiler. But don’t worry about this… Fortunately most of the heavy lifting is done by the compiler, which is the interpreter that converts the code from human readable to machine readable. Machine code is the lowest level and all programming languages we actually use are at an higher level. This was not always the case: programming used to be extremely low level. In your own time, take a look at this Sonic 3D renderer video! Interpreted means that the programming language does not need to be compiled (i.e. translated to a machine code sequence of 0s and 1s) before execution, but rather is translated and executed line by line by our interpreter. This allows the language to be more dynamic and flexible, but also slower and less efficient than compiled languages. One of the advantages of interpreted languages is that you can execute commands directly in the console, in addition to writing and saving these in a script. This is useful for testing and debugging your code, or for performing quick calculations and operations. Non-interpreted languages, on the other hand, have to be fully written and compiled top-to-bottom before execution. General-purpose means that the programming language can be used for a variety of applications and domains, and is not limited to a specific purpose or task. This makes the language more versatile and adaptable, but also less specialized and optimized than domain-specific languages. General-purpose languages can be used for web development, video game engineering, automation, and… scientific computing, among other things. 1.1.2 R and Python Well, finally it’s time to introduce our two friends. And as with any good introduction, we give a bit of history. R is an high-level, interpreted language for statistical computing and graphics. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in 1993. It is based on the S language, which was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and others in the 1970s. R is free and open source, and has a large and active community of users and developers. R is especially popular among statisticians, data scientists, and researchers in various fields. Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It was created by Max Verstappen in the Netherlands 5 years ago. Nah, just kidding… It was made though in the Netherlands in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI). It is named after the comedy group Monty Python, and has a philosophy of simplicity, readability, and elegance. Python is also free and open source, and has a huge and diverse community of users and developers. Python is widely used for a variety of tasks and it’s getting more and more popular in statistics and for scientific computing. Both R and Python have many advantages and features that make them suitable for mathematical applications, such as: They are easy to learn and use, with clear and consistent syntax and semantics. They allow you to write concise and elegant code that can handle complex problems, without getting too lost in complicated syntax (have a look at some C or Fortran code for instance). They are extensible and modular, supporting multiple paradigms and styles of programming, such as functional, object-oriented, and procedural. For this course, we will be focusing on functional programming. In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, as we will learn, and this goes well with mathematics and scientific computing. They have rich and comprehensive libraries and packages that provide a wide range of functions and tools for various domains and tasks, such as linear algebra, optimization, machine learning, visualization, and web scraping. They have interactive and user-friendly environments and interfaces that facilitate development and debugging, such as the console, the editor, and the notebook. We will be using, for this module R studio. You should install R Studio with either R or Python at this point. You will find how to do this in the first part of the lab. Do not continue unless you have R Studio installed and ready. 1.2 Computing, Accessing Memory and Storing We covered the three components of the computer: the CPU, the memory and the storage. Well, a programming language is a powerful tool that allows to build a set of instructions that use all these three components. By the end of this chapter, we won’t be able to write a full program yet, but hopefully we will show how these three interact. Before we proceed, a quick rundown on how to read the lines of code in these notes. Every once in a while you will see a chunk of code, and sometimes a result of what the chunk of code does. For example: # Hi, I am a chunk of R code that prints to output &quot;Beep bop beep&quot; print(&quot;Beep bop beep&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Beep bop beep&quot; As the comment (that bit in gray that starts with the #), suggests, what you saw is a chunk of R code that prints to output the text “Beep bop beep”. On top you will find the code, and on the bottom the result, i.e. the output. The comment does not get executed, so it’s just an explanation of what you are seeing. The actual code statement, print(\"Beep bop beep\"), is the one that does all the job, and, as the comments sugests, prints the text “Beep bop beep”. Wait, but I thought we would have learned Python in this module? Well, patience, my dear friend. The python equivalent of that statement would be: # Hi, I am a chunk of Python code that prints to output &quot;Beep bop beep&quot; print(&quot;Beep bop beep&quot;) ## Beep bop beep Wait, they’re basically the same? Well, yes, that’s the point, and the reason why we teach them both simultaneously. Despite the culture war that there’s currently in Statistics and Data Science, we believe that there’s no such thing as a best programming language: the expert carpenter should use all tools available at this hand. R and Python, for scientific computing, are almost equivalent at this day, and given recent developments, they can work together. Now that you are learning, pick one, based off your future modules. Don’t worry, for your project you will have to pick either one, or the other, so it’s not a requirement to learn both R and Python. But if you are confident enough, feel to learn both, you’re more then welcome. As a matter of fact, for all the these notes, we will always try to have them both side to side. On the left you will always an R code chunk, and on the right you will find the Python equivalent: R print(&quot;R chunk on the left.&quot;) ## [1] &quot;R chunk on the left.&quot; python print(&quot;Python chunk on the right.&quot;) ## Python chunk on the right. If for formatting reasons we won’t be able to show the code side to side, you can always tell which is which by the bold text immediately above the chunk, e.g. R or python. 1.2.1 A glorified calculator That’s it, the CPU. End of the Section. The CPU is a glorified calculator, nothing more to it, even if sometimes you might have heard complex codes and names like i7, i5, A4, Pentium 5, Neural Pre-processor, Snapdragon, Qbits, SmartBpprop, Bombastic, Mr fantastic, etc. Anyway, let us not worry about this now, but open up a new script, either an R or Python. Copy and paste the following code snippets into it. Then, placing your cursor next to each snippet, press ctrl + enter on your keyboard, you will see the result popping up in the console. What’s going to happen under the hood once you are sending a command to R or Python, is that process I mentioned earlier. The interpreter, will convert your command into machine code, and pass it down to the processor. The processor is going to crunch the numbers, and send back an output, that will then be displayed on your screen. This is how we do additions: R 3 + 5 ## [1] 8 python 3 + 5 ## 8 The result is automatically printed back to the user. Now, this is how we do subtractions: R 3 - 5 ## [1] -2 python 3 - 5 ## -2 And this is how we do additions and subtractions, and multiplications, and algebra in general: R 3 + 5 * 2 ## [1] 13 python 3 + 5 * 2 ## 13 The order of the operations comes from algebra, so in that snippet, we will first have 5 * 2, that gives us 10, and then we will do 3 + 10. Of course we can do much more then simple additions of subtractions and multiplications. Here I have a list of basic operations we can do with both the languages. Note that the syntax will not always be the same: Operation R Example Python Example Add 2 + 3 2 + 3 Subtract 2 - 3 2 - 3 Multiply 2 * 3 2 * 3 Divide 2 / 3 2 / 3 Modulus 2 %% 3 2 % 3 Square root sqrt(2) math.sqrt(2) Power 2^3 2 ** 3 Cosine cos(2 * pi) math.cos(2 * math.pi) Sine sin(pi / 2) math.sin(math.pi / 2) Tangent tan(pi / 4) math.tan(math.pi / 4) Natural log log(2) math.log(2) Expontential exp(2) math.exp(2) Please note that in Python, you need to import the math module to use mathematical functions like sqrt, cos, sin, tan, log, and exp. Also, pi is accessed as math.pi in Python. At the start of your python script, just add the following: Python import math Don’t worry too much about this for now. 1.2.1.1 Exercise Using numbers of your own, try the other basic mathematical operations listed below. Split a £10 bill across 3 people, check if 91 is a prime number using the modulus with the first 5 primes or get the Euler number. Play around, be wild. 1.2.1.2 Putting an order to operations Once you’re happy, try stringing some of these calculations all into one command, for example: R 3 + 7 * 5 / 3 - 2 ## [1] 12.66667 (3 + 7) * 5 / (3 - 2) ## [1] 50 Python 3 + 7 * 5 / 3 - 2 ## 12.666666666666666 (3 + 7) * 5 / (3 - 2) ## 50.0 The multiplication and division calculations are performed first (* and /), followed by addition and subtraction (+ and -), going from left to right. You may remember this from School as BODMAS: Brackets, Orders (powers, square roots), Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction This can be overridden by using putting the calculations we want to perform first in brackets. For instance, there’s this formula that has been really bothering me. It popped up this morning at 4am, and kept me awake. What is the square root of three fourth, over a third minus 2 divided by pi square? A hunted seagull of chalk flying around the vast sea of obsidian that is the blackboard of my mind, over and over and over again: \\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{3/4}}{\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{\\pi^2}}. \\] Here you go, be free, little bird: R sqrt(3 / 4) / (1 / 3 - 2 / pi^2) ## [1] 6.626513 Python math.sqrt(3 / 4) / (1 / 3 - 2 / math.pi**2) ## 6.626513139875386 1.2.2 What if calculators could remember? Yeah, what if? Well, that’s what the memory is for, keeping things in mind. You can think of the memory as a bookshelf, filled with boxes. Or if you’re one fan of that Henry Popper, the Magician Kid of Hogtwarz, (I do not wish to pay for the rights to Warner Bros) it’s like that room filled with shelves and bottles of thoughts and spells. Yes, that’s a better image. So the CPU is the Ministerium of Evil Magicians can access each shelf whenever it feels or needs. Now, in a computer, of course, instead of bottles, you have areas of the memory, and instead of spells, you have numbers, or vectors, or strings (text, e.g. a series of characters). Now, the Ministerium, to access the spells and the thoughts in the bottles, has a bunch of Evil Magicians, that walk in the archive, and that can claim these bottles by putting labels onto them. Those magicians are, in the computer, our programs. Putting a label on an area of memory is called creating a variable. Tere’s the thing: when a magician grabs a bottle, they can either look at which thought or spell is in it, or put a new thought into it. An existing thought in a bottle cannot be modified. If they wish to keep the same bottle with the same label, but change the content, they open it, get rid of the old content, and simply put a new one. To give an example, Prof. Sinsinius Snap, to kill that guy that kinda of looks like Gandalf, needs to store two spells. In one he needs to store the formula of the spell that causes the victim to feel a lot of pain (this was in a children book, by the way), and in the other, the formula that makes the heart’s victim stop. To do so, it cretes two labels, spell_to_torture and spell_to_kill, so it won’t loose the bottles in the archive,and in each it puts the evil spell: R spell_to_torture &lt;- &quot;porcosus&quot; spell_to_kill &lt;- &quot;avada kebaba&quot; python spell_to_torture = &quot;porcosus&quot; spell_to_kill = &quot;avada kebaba&quot; What did we do? We assigned two strings, \"porcosus\" and \"avada kebaba\", indicative of our spells, in two variables, called spell_to_torture and spell_to_kill (the labels). You can read the code above as assign “porcosus” to spell_to_torture, and assign “avada kebaba” to spell_to_kill. This can be done with the &lt;- sign in R and with the = sign in Python. What we did reserved an area of memory where now our two strings are stored and are accessible to our program. Our dear Prof. Sinsinius Snap, to access the spells again, all he needs to do, is to recall the labels he used, e.g. the variable names, and the archive will remind him of the content of the bottles: R spell_to_torture ## [1] &quot;porcosus&quot; spell_to_kill ## [1] &quot;avada kebaba&quot; python spell_to_torture ## &#39;porcosus&#39; spell_to_kill ## &#39;avada kebaba&#39; Ouch! He realizes he putted the wrong spell in the spell_to_torture bottle. Well, no problem, as mentioned above, he can re-bottle the correct one. To do so, he simply reassigns the correct spell \"cruccio\" to the bottle labelled spell_to_torture: R spell_to_torture &lt;- &quot;cruccio&quot; python spell_to_torture = &quot;cruccio&quot; Note that now, the old spell \"porcosus\" is lost. In fact, when he looks at the spell_to_torture bottle, he sees: R spell_to_torture ## [1] &quot;cruccio&quot; python spell_to_torture ## &#39;cruccio&#39; “Well done Sinsinius!” he says, patting himself on the shoulder. 1.2.2.1 Doing maths with variables Now of course, this is a university, not a school of magic and divination, so we ultimately need to do some maths. In programming, we often need to store the results of our calculations for later use. This is where variables come in handy. We mentioned you can think of a variable as a bottle where you can store a value. You can give this bottle a label (a name), and use this label to refer to the bottled value later on. For example, let’s say we want to perform some calculations: R x &lt;- 20 - 16 y &lt;- 4 + 5 x - y ## [1] -5 Python x = 20 - 16 y = 4 + 5 x - y ## -5 Here, x and y are variables. We’ve assigned them the results of some calculations. Now, whenever we refer to x or y, we’re actually referring to the results of these calculations. We can check the values stored in x and y by simply typing their names: R x ## [1] 4 y ## [1] 9 Python x ## 4 y ## 9 Remember, R and Python are case-sensitive, so x is different from X. If you try to access X, you’ll get an error because we haven’t assigned anything to X: R X ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;X&#39; not found Python X ## name &#39;X&#39; is not defined Also, if you assign a new value to a variable, the old value will be overwritten without any warning: R x &lt;- -100 x ## [1] -100 Python x = -100 x ## -100 Now, here’s something cool. In maths, an equation like \\(x = x + 1\\) doesn’t make much sense. But in programming, it’s perfectly valid. It means “take the current value of x, add 1 to it, and store the result back in x”. This is a common way to increment a variable: R x &lt;- x + 1 x ## [1] -99 Python x = x + 1 x ## -99 In fact, you can use all mathematical operations in this way. You should use variables as much as you can to keep the code as clean and readable as possible. Let’s revisit the example above: R numerator &lt;- sqrt(3 / 4) denominator &lt;- (1 / 3 - 2 / pi^2) result &lt;- numerator / denominator result ## [1] 6.626513 Python numerator = math.sqrt(3 / 4) denominator = (1 / 3 - 2 / math.pi**2) result = numerator / denominator result ## 6.626513139875386 In this refactored code, we first calculate the numerator and the denominator separately and store them in variables. Then, we perform the division operation and store the result in another variable. This makes the code easier to read and understand. It also allows us to reuse the numerator and denominator calculations if needed elsewhere in the code. This is a good practice in programming. It not only makes the code cleaner but also more efficient. 1.2.3 Storing Data on the Hard Drive When you’re working with a programming language like R or Python, any variables you create are stored in your computer’s memory (the RAM). This is a type of storage that’s fast and easy for your computer to access, which is why it’s used for tasks that are currently running. However, memory is volatile, which means that once the power is turned off or your program finishes running, any data stored in memory is lost. Sometimes, you might want your program to produce something tangible that doesn’t get lost when the power is turned off or your program stops running. This could be a report, a graph, or even just a set of numbers. To do this, you can write this data to a file on your hard drive. Unlike memory, data stored on your hard drive remains there until it’s deleted, so you can access it again later. Let’s look at how you can write data to a file in R and Python. R # Create some data data &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Write the data to a file write.csv(data, file = &quot;data.csv&quot;) Python # Import the pandas library import pandas as pd # Create some data data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Convert the data to a DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Write the data to a file df.to_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;, index=False) In both of these examples, we’re creating a set of data (the numbers 1 through 5), and then writing this data to a file called “data.csv”. The write.csv function in R and the to_csv function in Python are used to write the data to a file. In R, when you see c(1, 2, 3), we’re making a vector. As in maths, this is a collection of numbers that you’ve bundled together in a specific order: first 1, then 2, then 3. In Python, when you see [1, 2, 3], it’s very similar. This in python is called a list. We’ll learn more about these collections (vectors in R and lists in Python) next week. For now, just remember that they are a way to keep your items organized and in a specific order. It’s like having a container where you can keep your things neatly instead of having them scattered all over the place. This makes it easier to find what you need later on. Moreover, in the Python example, you might have noticed the pd.DataFrame statement. This is a way to create a DataFrame, which is a kind of table, using the pandas library. Again, don’t worry! We’ll cover these topics in more detail later on. For now, just know that we’re using a DataFrame to store our data in a structured way that can be easily written to a file. Now, let’s talk about CSV files. CSV stands for “Comma-Separated Values”. It’s a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line of the file is a data record, and each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. This is why it’s called a “comma-separated values” file. When we write our data to a CSV file, each item of data goes into its own field, and each set of data (like a row from a table) goes into its own record. This makes CSV files a great way to store tabular data, because it’s easy to input the data into a spreadsheet or database program later on. I encourage you to open the “data.csv” file we created in a text editor or spreadsheet program. You’ll see that the data is stored in a structured, easy-to-read format. Each number is in its own field, and each set of numbers is in its own record. Remember, storing data on your hard drive is a great way to preserve your data for later use. It’s also a great way to share your data with others, or to move your data between different programs. So don’t be afraid to use file input and output in your own programs. It’s a powerful tool that can help you do more with your data. 1.2.3.1 Reading back your data Now, let’s say we want to access this data at a later time. We can do this by reading the file back into our program. Here’s how you can do it in R and Python: R # Read the data from the file data_from_file &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;) # Print the data print(data_from_file) ## X0 ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 ## 5 5 Python # Read the data from the file data_from_file = pd.read_csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;) # Print the data print(data_from_file) ## 0 ## 0 1 ## 1 2 ## 2 3 ## 3 4 ## 4 5 In both of these examples, we’re using the read.csv function in R and the read_csv function in Python to read the data from the file back into our program. When we print this data, we can see that it’s the same as the data we originally wrote to the file. This is a basic introduction to storing data on your hard drive using R and Python. There’s a lot more you can do with file input and output, but this should give you a good starting point. Remember, the key is to use variables to store your data in memory while your program is running, and then write this data to a file on your hard drive if you want to keep it for later. .book .book-body .page-wrapper .page-inner { max-width: 1200px !important; } "],["log_vec.html", "2 Logic and Vectors 2.1 Comparisons 2.2 Logical Arithmetic 2.3 Flow 2.4 Vectors 2.5 Accessing vectors", " 2 Logic and Vectors In this chapter, we will introduce you to the basics of logic in a computer. Computer Logic is related in its own way to the branch of mathematical logic, in particular with the branch of Boolean algebra. And if truth is something elusive in the philosophical discourse, in Boolean algebra it is well defined, as the \\(\\land, \\ \\lor, \\lnot\\) logic operators are. If you’re used to these, for the rest of this chapter, we will use a different notation for these three symbols: AND, OR and NOT. In programming, logic is essential, as it allows us to create and manipulate expressions and statements that can be evaluated as true or false. In this way logic enables us to control the flow and structure of our programs, and to perform various operations and calculations on data. 2.1 Comparisons Before we start with the logic, we should cover what comparison is. I mean, we can again phylosofize about it, but pulling out the Oxford English Dictionary, “[Comparison is ] the action, or an act, of comparing, likening, or representing as similar: see compare.” If we pull out the definition of compare, we simply get “To liken”. The concept of comparison is inherit in human existence, as it’s the concept of what TRUE is, (Kierkegaard lost his mind to find out that there’s not a way that two things are the same, that truth is subjective, and that please do not compare people, that is not nice). Anyway, in programming, comparison is the process of examining two or more objects or values and determining their relationship or difference. Comparison can be used for various purposes, such as checking the validity of an input, showing that two variables contain the same item, or most importantly to control the flow of a program (later with this). For now, let’s focus on how to compare objects and values in both R and Python, and how to use the results of comparison in your programs. First, let’s see how to check for equality in R and Python. Equality means that two objects or values are exactly the same in every aspect. To check for equality, we use the operator ==, which returns TRUE if the objects or values are equal, and FALSE if they are not. As you will see, R uses uppercase letters for TRUE and FALSE, while Python uses lowercase letters for True and False. For example, we can compare two strings, two integers, or two doubles, as shown below: R # Comparing two strings &quot;Hello&quot; == &quot;Hello&quot; ## [1] TRUE &quot;Hello&quot; == &quot;hello&quot; ## [1] FALSE # Comparing two integers 2 == 2 ## [1] TRUE 2 == 3 ## [1] FALSE # Comparing two doubles 3.14 == 3.14 ## [1] TRUE 3.14 == 3.1415 ## [1] FALSE python # Comparing two strings &quot;Hello&quot; == &quot;Hello&quot; ## True &quot;Hello&quot; == &quot;hello&quot; ## False # Comparing two integers 2 == 2 ## True 2 == 3 ## False # Comparing two doubles 3.14 == 3.14 ## True 3.14 == 3.1415 ## False From these examples, we can notice how the computer is, indeed, very strict with the definition of equality. Two things might seem similar, or likely to be the same, but they are not. Note that the comparison is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different. Also note that the comparison is precise, meaning that even a small difference in the decimal places can make two doubles unequal. Try adding more decimals to the above examples, and see how far you can get until you get two same numbers! The amount of decimal places in doubles is at the basis of precision and how comparisons of doubles are made will affect your programs. For this reason be careful when you compare two floats and try to avoid equality. Similar to equality, we can check for inequality. Inequality means that two objects or values are not exactly the same in every aspect. To check for inequality, we use the operator !=, which returns TRUE if the objects or values are not equal, and FALSE if they are. As earlier: R # Comparing two strings &quot;Hello&quot; != &quot;Hello&quot; ## [1] FALSE &quot;Hello&quot; != &quot;hello&quot; ## [1] TRUE # Comparing two integers 2 != 2 ## [1] FALSE 2 != 3 ## [1] TRUE # Comparing two doubles 3.14 != 3.14 ## [1] FALSE 3.14 != 3.1415 ## [1] TRUE python # Comparing two strings &quot;Hello&quot; != &quot;Hello&quot; ## False &quot;Hello&quot; != &quot;hello&quot; ## True # Comparing two integers 2 != 2 ## False 2 != 3 ## True # Comparing two doubles 3.14 != 3.14 ## False 3.14 != 3.1415 ## True As mentioned above, we can also compare the content of variables. As we learned last week, a variable is a name that refers to a value or an object that is stored in the memory, so by comparing variables we compare the value they refer to. For example, we can assign the string \"Hello\" to the variable x in both languages, as shown below: R # Assigning a string to a variable x &lt;- &quot;Hello&quot; python # Assigning a string to a variable x = &quot;Hello&quot; And we can then use the same operators as before, == for equality and != for inequality. For example, we can compare the variable x with another string, another variable, or itself, as shown below: R # Comparing a variable with a string x == &quot;Hello&quot; ## [1] TRUE x == &quot;hello&quot; ## [1] FALSE # Comparing a variable with another variable y &lt;- &quot;World&quot; x == y ## [1] FALSE y &lt;- &quot;Hello&quot; x == y ## [1] TRUE # Comparing a variable with itself x == x ## [1] TRUE python # Comparing a variable with a string x == &quot;Hello&quot; ## True x == &quot;hello&quot; ## False # Comparing a variable with another variable y = &quot;World&quot; x == y ## False y = &quot;Hello&quot; x == y ## True # Comparing a variable with itself x == x ## True In addition to equality and inequality, we can also compare the magnitude or the order of two values or objects. This is especially useful in computational maths, as we often need to check if a value is within a certain range, or if a value satisfies a certain condition. To compare the magnitude or the order of two values or objects, we use the following operators: Greater than (&gt;): This operator returns TRUE if the left operand is larger than the right operand, and FALSE otherwise. For example, 3 &gt; 2 returns TRUE, but 2 &gt; 3 returns FALSE. Less than (&lt;): This operator returns TRUE if the left operand is smaller than the right operand, and FALSE otherwise. Greater than or equal to (&gt;=): This operator returns TRUE if the left operand is larger than or equal to the right operand, and FALSE otherwise. For example, 3 &gt;= 2 and 3 &gt;= 3 both return TRUE, but 2 &gt;= 3 returns FALSE. Less than or equal to (&lt;=): As above, this operator returns TRUE if the left operand is smaller than or equal to the right operand, and FALSE otherwise. The comparison is going to be consistent with the equality and inequality operators, meaning that if x == y, then x &gt;= y and x &lt;= y are both TRUE, and if x != y, then either x &gt; y or x &lt; y is TRUE. As an exercise, try to compare two integers, two doubles, or two variables, as done above, but with the inequality operators, and see the result. In the next section, we will introduce you to another important aspect of logic: logical arithmetic. Logical arithmetic is the process of combining and manipulating logical values, such as TRUE and FALSE, using logical operators, such as AND and OR. Logical arithmetic can be used for various purposes, such as creating complex conditions, testing multiple hypotheses, or performing set operations. In this section, we will show you how to use logical arithmetic in both R and Python, and how to use the results of logical arithmetic in your programs. 2.2 Logical Arithmetic This might seem easy if you already have a background in logic, but even if you haven’t, the following paragraphs should cover all the necessary concepts that you will need for programming. Logical arithmetic is the process of combining and manipulating logical values, TRUE and FALSE, which are logic operands, using the logical operators AND and OR or NOT. Let’s start from AND and OR: The AND operator returns TRUE if both operands are TRUE, and FALSE otherwise. The OR operator returns TRUE if either or both operands are TRUE, and FALSE otherwise. We can use the AND and OR operators to combine two logical values, such as TRUE and FALSE, as shown below: R # Using the AND operator TRUE &amp; TRUE ## [1] TRUE TRUE &amp; FALSE ## [1] FALSE FALSE &amp; TRUE ## [1] FALSE FALSE &amp; FALSE ## [1] FALSE # Using the OR operator TRUE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE TRUE | FALSE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | TRUE ## [1] TRUE FALSE | FALSE ## [1] FALSE python # Using the AND operator True and True ## True True and False ## False False and True ## False False and False ## False # Using the OR operator True or True ## True True or False ## True False or True ## True False or False ## False The syntax and the output are very similar in both languages, except that R uses &amp; and | for AND and OR, while Python uses and and or. More formally, we can use a table to show all the possible outcomes of the AND and OR operators. Let’s say that \\(a, \\ b\\) are our operands, then: \\(a\\) \\(b\\) \\(a\\) AND \\(b\\) \\(a\\) OR \\(b\\) TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE The table has four rows, corresponding to the four possible combinations of the operands a and b. Again, the table is easy to build, as it shows a AND b is only TRUE when both a and b are TRUE, a OR b is only FALSE when both a and b are FALSE. 2.2.1 Precendence of operators In logical operations, as in general algebra, the precedence of operators determines the order in which operations are performed: Logical NOT: This operator has the highest precedence and is performed first Logical AND: This operator has the next highest precedence after Logical NOT Logical OR: This operator has lower precedence than Logical AND So, in an expression without parentheses, the NOT operation is performed first, followed by the AND operation, and finally the OR operation. For example, in the expression NOT p AND q AND r, the operations would be performed in the following order: NOT p is performed first due to the highest precedence of NOT. Then, (NOTp) AND q is performed due to the next highest precedence of AND. Finally, ((NOT p) AND q) OR r is performed due to the lowest precedence of OR. Parentheses can be used to change this order. For example, in the expression p ∧ (q ∨ r), the operation q ∨ r is performed first due to the parentheses, even though ∨ has lower precedence than ∧. For example, consider the following expression: TRUE | TRUE &amp; FALSE Without parentheses, in this expression the AND operator has higher precedence than the OR operator, so it is evaluated first. The result is then combined with the OR operator. The expression is equivalent to: TRUE | (TRUE &amp; FALSE) However, if we use parentheses to group the operands differently, we can change the order of evaluation and the result of the expression. If we use parentheses to group the first and the last operands, we get: (TRUE | TRUE) &amp; FALSE The value of this expression is in fact FALSE. Now, the OR operator is evaluated first, giving TRUE and the result is then combined with the AND operator, giving FALSE. 2.2.1.1 Exercise To test your understanding of logical arithmetic, try to find what is the value of: TRUE | TRUE &amp; FALSE? FALSE | FALSE &amp; TRUE? (TRUE &amp; FALSE) | (FALSE &amp; TRUE)? (TRUE | TRUE) &amp; FALSE? (TRUE | FALSE) &amp; (FALSE | TRUE)? You should use the console in R or Python to check your answers. You can review the table and the examples above, and try to understand the logic behind each expression. 2.3 Flow Another important aspect of logic is flow. Flow is the order and direction in which the instructions of a program are executed and is at the base of an algorithm. Normally, a computer program, has a start, it will do something, and then terminate (return an output). This is called the flow of a program. Now, of course, to control the flow, you need a mechanism that checks on the state of your program, and performs an action based on the state in which you are. Surprisingly enough, we run programs in every day tasks too. When driving down from Glasgow to London, we need to check where we are, and turn the steering wheel accordingly in such a way that our car points towards South. When doing the laundry in a laundrette, we first check the amounts of money we have, and then, if we have enough, load up the washing machine, if we don’t, well, we need to get some more. Or say, for example, that you need to code something, maybe for an assignment :) What you might end up doing, is the following: I have to remark that this was a joke: remember that if you cheat at this stage with programming you are just cheating yourself. More formally, in computer programs, flow can be controlled by using conditional statements, such as if - else if - else. Conditional statements allow us to execute different blocks of code depending on the result of a logical expression or condition. For example, we can use conditional statements to perform different actions based on the value of a variable, the input of the user, or the outcome of a calculation. 2.3.1 The if-then-else statement The simplest form of a conditional statement is the if statement. The if statement checks a single condition, and executes a block of code if the condition is true. For example, we can use an if statement to print a message if a variable is positive, as shown below: R # Assigning a value to a variable x &lt;- 10 # Using an if statement if (x &gt; 0) { print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;x is positive&quot; # x is positive python # Assigning a value to a variable x = 10 # Using an if statement if x &gt; 0: print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) ## x is positive # x is positive Concerning syntax, e.g. the way we write the code: To enclose the condition that is checked by the if statement, e.g. where your logic expression goes (e.g. the block of code that evaluates either to TRUE or FALSE): R uses an if followed by parentheses (), where the condition goes Python has no parentheses, but has a : symbol to indicate that the condition has ended and the block of code to execute has started To denote the block of code to execute if the condition is true: R uses curly braces {} to enclose the block of code that is executed if the condition is true. All code that is relative to the if condition needs to be within these brackets Python, uses indentation to delimit the block of execution. All code that needs to execute needs to be indented at the same level. Indentation in Python is achieved either with a tab (recommended), or with 4 spaces. The if statement only executes the block of code if the condition is true, and does nothing otherwise. This means, that if the condition is FALSE, the program will simply skip the code within the block, as if it never existed. Sometimes, we may want to check more than one condition, and execute different blocks of code for each condition. For this, we can use the if - else if - else statement. The if - else if - else statement checks multiple conditions in order, and executes the first block of code that corresponds to a true condition. If none of the conditions are true, the else block of code is executed. For example, we can use an if - else if - else statement to print a message based on the sign of a variable, as shown below: R # Assigning a value to a variable x &lt;- 10 # Using an if - else if - else statement if (x &lt; 0) { print(&quot;x is negative&quot;) } else if (x == 0) { print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) } else { print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;x is positive&quot; # x is positive python # Assigning a value to a variable x = 10 # Using an if - else if - else statement if x &lt; 0: print(&quot;x is negative&quot;) elif x == 0: print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) ## x is positive # x is positive Concerning syntax, R uses else if and Python uses elif for the second condition. The order of the conditions is important, as only the first condition that is true is executed. If none of the conditions are true, the else block is executed. Sometimes, we may want to check two or more independent conditions, and execute different blocks of code for each condition. For this, we can use two or more if statements one after another. This is different from using an if - else if - else statement, as each if statement is evaluated separately, and more than one block of code can be executed. For example, we can use two if statements to print a message based on the divisibility of a variable by 2 and 3, as shown below: R # Assigning a value to a variable n &lt;- 12 # Using two if statements if (n %% 2 == 0) { print(&quot;n is divisible by 2&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;n is divisible by 2&quot; if (n %% 3 == 0) { print(&quot;n is divisible by 3&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;n is divisible by 3&quot; # n is divisible by 2 # n is divisible by 3 python # Assigning a value to a variable n = 12 # Using two if statements if n % 2 == 0: print(&quot;n is divisible by 2&quot;) ## n is divisible by 2 if n % 3 == 0: print(&quot;n is divisible by 3&quot;) ## n is divisible by 3 # n is divisible by 2 # n is divisible by 3 In R the modulo operator is %%, while Python uses %. Both if statements are executed, as both conditions are true. If we used an if - else if - else statement instead, only the first condition would be executed, and the second condition would be ignored. 2.3.2 Nesting if-statements Sometimes, we may want to check a condition within another condition, and execute different blocks of code for each combination. For this, we can use a nested if statement. A nested if statement is an if statement inside another if statement. A nested if statement can have multiple levels of nesting, and can also include else if and else blocks. For example, we can use a nested if statement to print a message based on the value and the sign of a variable, as shown below: R # Assigning a value to a variable x &lt;- -10 # Using a nested if statement if (x &gt; 0) { if (x &gt; 10) { print(&quot;x is positive and greater than 10&quot;) } else { print(&quot;x is positive and less than or equal to 10&quot;) } } else { if (x &lt; -10) { print(&quot;x is negative and less than -10&quot;) } else { print(&quot;x is negative and greater than or equal to -10&quot;) } } ## [1] &quot;x is negative and greater than or equal to -10&quot; python # Assigning a value to a variable x = -10 # Using a nested if statement if x &gt; 0: if x &gt; 10: print(&quot;x is positive and greater than 10&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is positive and less than or equal to 10&quot;) else: if x &lt; -10: print(&quot;x is negative and less than -10&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is negative and greater than or equal to -10&quot;) ## x is negative and greater than or equal to -10 Concerning syntax, you can now see the double indentation in the python code. The nested if statement checks the outer condition first (x being positive), and then checks the inner condition if the outer condition is true (x being greater then 10). Note also that the nested if statement can have multiple levels of nesting, and can also include else if and else blocks. In the next section, we will introduce you to a fun and popular game that involves logic and flow: FizzBuzz. 2.3.3 FizzBuzz FizzBuzz is a game that tests your ability to use logic and flow in programming. The rules of the game are simple: given a number, print “Fizz” if the number is divisible by 3, print “Buzz” if the number is divisible by 5, print “FizzBuzz” if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, and print the number itself otherwise. For example, given the number 15, print “FizzBuzz”, given the number 9, print “Fizz”, given the number 10, print “Buzz”, and given the number 7, print 7. To play FizzBuzz in R or Python, we can use a variable to store the number, and then use an if - else if - else statement to check the conditions and print the output, as shown below: R # Assigning a value to a variable n &lt;- 15 # Playing FizzBuzz if (n %% 3 == 0 &amp; n %% 5 == 0) { print(&quot;FizzBuzz&quot;) } else if (n %% 3 == 0) { print(&quot;Fizz&quot;) } else if (n %% 5 == 0) { print(&quot;Buzz&quot;) } else { print(n) } ## [1] &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; python # Assigning a value to a variable n = 15 # Playing FizzBuzz if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0: print(&quot;FizzBuzz&quot;) elif n % 3 == 0: print(&quot;Fizz&quot;) elif n % 5 == 0: print(&quot;Buzz&quot;) else: print(n) ## FizzBuzz The Fizzbuzz condition uses the modulo %% (% in Python) operator. This, recall, returns the remainder of the division. The logical and operator returns true if both operands are true. Note also that the order of the conditions is important, as we need to check the divisibility by both 3 and 5 first, and then we check the divisibility by 3 or 5 separately. To see how FizzBuzz works, try to replace the value of the variable n with different numbers, and see what the output is. For example, try n &lt;- 45 in R, or n = 45 in Python, and see what happens! 2.3.3.1 Exercise: Skibbidifizzbuzz As an exercise, try to write a variation of FizzBuzz, called Skibbidifizzbuzz, where the rules are the same as above, but now you have to add “Skibbidi” if the number is divisible by 2. For example, given the number 12, print “SkibbidiFizz”, given the number 20, print “SkibbidiBuzz”, given the number 30, print “SkibbidiFizzBuzz”, and given the number 8, print “Skibbidi”. HINT To write a quick solution, you will need to collate strings. This means that if we have the strings \"a\", \"b\", collated those will be \"ab\", and if we have \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\", collated they will read \"abba\" (mammamia). To collate strings in R and python: R # collate strings paste0(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) ## [1] &quot;abbc&quot; # you can also collate strings saved in variables string_in_a_variable &lt;- &quot;mia&quot; paste0(&quot;mamma&quot;, string_in_a_variable) ## [1] &quot;mammamia&quot; python # collate strings &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; ## &#39;abbc&#39; # you can also collate strings saved in variables string_in_a_variable = &quot;mia&quot; &quot;mamma&quot; + string_in_a_variable ## &#39;mammamia&#39; Which strings could you collate for “SkibbidiFizzBuzz”? 2.4 Vectors We now introduce the first (and the most fundamental!) data structures in programming: vectors. Vectors, as in maths, are ordered collections of values that can be manipulated as a single unit. All elements in a vector need to be homogeneous, e.g. of the same type, for example we cannot have a vector with a string and an integer together. Later on, when we will introduce matrices, we will find out that these are nothing but a collection of vectors (vectors of vectors). And we, in maths, know how powerful linear algebra is: through vectors, we can store, process, and analyze large amounts of numerical data efficiently and elegantly. 2.4.1 Creating vectors We will now see how to create and use vectors in R and Python, and how to perform element wise operations on vectors. To create a vector in R, we use the c function, which stands for concatenate. The c function takes one or more values as arguments, and returns a vector that contains those values. For example, we can create a vector that contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, as shown below: # Creating a vector in R x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) x ## [1] 1 2 3 To create a vector in Python, we use the array function from the numpy module, which stands for numerical Python. While technically the Python array is not the same of an R vector (as you can have arrays of arrays, which is a similar structure to a matrix), we will use the Python array interchangeably for now, as they behave very similar and they fulfill similar roles. The first thing to use arrays in python, is to import the numpy array. The numpy module is a library that provides various tools and functions for working with numerical data and scientific computing. The array function takes a list as an argument, and returns an array that contains the elements of the list. A list, in Python, is another, built-in structure to represent and ordered set of data, but it comes from the original python, was designed with different aims, and comes with a lot less powers then the numpy array. So for now, please stick to the following when you create vectors in python. We can create an array that contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, as shown below: # Importing the numpy module import numpy as np # This is a simple python list [1, 2, 3] ## [1, 2, 3] # Creating an array in Python x = np.array([1, 2, 3]) x ## array([1, 2, 3]) We need to import the numpy library before using the array function, and we use the alias np to refer to the module. Therefore, before we proceed it is probably a good time to introduce what a library is. 2.4.1.1 Libraries A library is a collection of code that provides predefined functions, classes, variables, and other resources that can be used by other programs. Libraries can save time and effort by allowing programmers to reuse existing code and avoid writing everything from scratch. Libraries can also enhance the functionality and the performance of a programming language by offering specialized tools and features that are not built-in. For example, the numpy library is a library that provides various tools and functions for working with numerical data and scientific computing. The numpy library is not part of the standard Python language, but it can be installed and imported by using the import statement. The import statement tells Python to load the library and make it available for use. The import statement can also assign an alias or a nickname to the library, such as np, to make it easier to refer to the library in the code. Normally, one has to reference import numpy as np only at the beginning of the script, before using any of the functions or resources from the numpy library: python # this is the math library from past week! import math # Importing the numpy library and assigning an alias import numpy as np # rest of your script! # # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ # This way, Python knows where to find the functions that is needed, and the programmer does not have to repeat the import statement every time. R has libraries too, those are imported via the command library, but we will see how to use these at a later time as R has already plenty of scientific computing functions and structures built in. 2.4.1.2 Creating sequences One of the common ways to create vectors or arrays is to use sequences. Sequences are ordered collections of values that follow a certain pattern or rule. Sequences can be useful for generating data, plotting, or creating loops, as we will see later on. As you will see, here the syntax is going to be a bit different in each language, as R uses functions such : or seq and Python uses np.arange or np.linspace to create and initialize vectors. We will see how to create sequences of integers, any sequence of equally spaced numbers, and finally, how to initialize an empty vectors with all same values. To create a sequence of integers in R, we can use the colon operator :, in Python, we can use the arange function from numpy. Both take two integers as arguments, and returns a vector or an array that contains all the integers from the first argument to the second argument, with a step size of 1. For example, we can create a sequence of integers from -5 to 10, as shown below: R # Creating a sequence of integers from -5 to 10 x &lt;- -5:10 x ## [1] -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 python # Creating a sequence of integers from -5 to 10 x = np.arange(-5, 11) x ## array([-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) Differently from R, arange requires the second argument to be one step more than the desired end point of the sequence, so if we want to go up to 10, we need to have the second argument to be 11. To create any sequence, we can use the seq function in R, and the arange or linspace functions in Python. For example, we can create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a step size of 0.1, or with a length of 11, as shown below: R The seq function in R can take named arguments, such as from, to, by, or length.out, to specify the parameters of the sequence. # Creating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a step size of 0.1 x &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1) x ## [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 # Creating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a length of 11 y &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 11) y ## [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 python The np.arange function in Python, with an additional argument, will indicate the step size. Again, in this case, arange requires the second argument to be one step more than the desired end point of the sequence. The np.linspace function, instead, will create a vector of a desired length (11 elements) of equally spaced elements. It requires the third argument to be the desired length of the sequence. # Creating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a step size of 0.1 x = np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1) x ## array([0. , 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1. ]) # Creating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a length of 11 y = np.linspace(0, 1, 11) y ## array([0. , 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1. ]) Empty vectors. Lastly, there might be some cases where we have to create an empty vector or array in R and Python. An empty vector or array can be useful for initializing a vector or array that will be filled with values later, as we will see in the next chapters. For this, we can use the vector or array function, respectively, and specify the type and the length of the vector or array. An empty vector or array is a vector or array that contains no values, but has a predefined type and length. For example, we can create an empty vector or array of type numeric and length 5, as shown below: R # Creating an empty vector of type numeric and length 5 x &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;numeric&quot;, length = 5) x ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 python # Creating an empty array of type numeric and length 5 x = np.empty(5, dtype = &quot;float&quot;) x ## array([4.9e-324, 9.9e-324, 1.5e-323, 2.0e-323, 2.5e-323]) Note that the vector function in R takes the mode argument to specify the type of the vector, and the length argument to specify the length of the vector. The np.empty function in Python takes the the length of the array as the first argument, and the dtype argument to specify the type of the array, e.g. integer, float, Python object, etc. 2.4.2 Modifying vectors One of the main advantages of using vectors or arrays is that we can perform elementwise operations on them. Elementwise operations are operations that are applied to each element of the vector or the array individually, and return a new vector or array that contains the results. Elementwise operations preserve the shape and the length of the vector or the array, meaning that the resulting vector or array has the same number of elements as the original vector or array. For example, we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide a vector or an array by a scalar (which is a single value): R # Adding a scalar to a vector x + 1 ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 # Subtracting a scalar from a vector x - 1 ## [1] -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 # Multiplying a vector by a scalar x * 2 ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 # Dividing a vector by a scalar x / 2 ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 python # Adding a scalar to an array x + 1 ## array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.]) # Subtracting a scalar from an array x - 1 ## array([-1., -1., -1., -1., -1.]) # Multiplying an array by a scalar x * 2 ## array([1.e-323, 2.e-323, 3.e-323, 4.e-323, 5.e-323]) # Dividing an array by a scalar x / 2 ## array([0.e+000, 5.e-324, 1.e-323, 1.e-323, 1.e-323]) The element wise operations are performed by using the same arithmetic operators as the past chapter, such as +, -, *, and /. 2.4.2.1 Functions and algebra with vectors But we can do more! One of the benefits of using vectors or arrays is that we can apply a whole function, such as sin(.) or log(.), on the entire vector elementwise. This means that the function is applied to each element of the vector individually, and returns a new vector that contains the results. For example, let’s apply the sin(.) function, which calculates the sine of an angle in radians, on a vector that contains the angles \\(0\\), \\(\\pi/2\\), \\(\\pi\\), and \\(3 \\pi/2\\): R # Creating a vector of angles in radians x &lt;- c(0, pi/2, pi, 3*pi/2) x ## [1] 0.000000 1.570796 3.141593 4.712389 # Applying the sin function on the vector elementwise sin(x) ## [1] 0.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 1.224647e-16 -1.000000e+00 python # Creating an array of angles in radians x = np.array([0, np.pi/2, np.pi, 3*np.pi/2]) x ## array([0. , 1.57079633, 3.14159265, 4.71238898]) # Applying the sin function on the array elementwise np.sin(x) ## array([ 0.0000000e+00, 1.0000000e+00, 1.2246468e-16, -1.0000000e+00]) The function is applied to each element of the vector or the array individually, and returns a new vector or array that contains the results. Note also that by default the results are in scientific notation. We can also apply many other functions! Go back to last week introduction and see how many of the functions we introduced already, such as log(), run elementwise on vectors. And as we can sum two scalars, another benefit of using vectors or arrays is that we can do elementwise product and sum of two vectors. If two vectors or arrays are the same length, this will return a new vector or array that contains the elementwise results of your desired operation: R # Creating two vectors of the same length x &lt;- 1:4 y &lt;- 5:8 # Doing elementwise product of two vectors x * y ## [1] 5 12 21 32 # Doing elementwise sum of two vectors x + y ## [1] 6 8 10 12 python # Creating two arrays of the same length x = np.arange(1, 5) y = np.arange(5, 9) # Doing elementwise product of two arrays x * y ## array([ 5, 12, 21, 32]) # Doing elementwise sum of two arrays x + y ## array([ 6, 8, 10, 12]) The elementwise product and sum are performed by using the same arithmetic operators as before, such as * and +. Note also that the elementwise product and sum preserve the shape and the length of the vectors or the arrays, meaning that the resulting vector or array has the same number of elements as the input vectors or arrays. 2.4.2.2 Doing the dot product of two vectors Lastly, one important operation that we can do with vectors or arrays is the dot product, and this will be super useful to you in the future as you will deal with applications in linear algebra, geometry, and machine learning. Recall that the dot product takes two vectors or arrays of the same length, and returns a single number that is the sum of the elementwise products of the vectors or arrays. For example, the dot product of the vectors [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5, 6, 7, 8] is 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 4*8 = 70. To calculate the dot product of two vectors or arrays in R and Python, we use the following functions: In R, we use the %*% operator, which performs matrix multiplication. If the input vectors are one-dimensional, the matrix multiplication is equivalent to the dot product. For example, we can calculate the dot product of two vectors, as shown below: # Doing the dot product of two vectors x %*% y ## [,1] ## [1,] 70 In Python, we use the dot function from the numpy module, which performs the dot product of two arrays. For example, we can calculate the dot product of two arrays, as shown below: # Doing the dot product of two arrays np.dot(x, y) ## 70 The syntax are quite different in both languages, as R uses a special operator and Python uses a function from numpy. Note also that the dot product requires the input vectors or arrays to have the same length, otherwise it will produce an error. We will cover how to do algebra with Python and R in the next chapters. 2.5 Accessing vectors We will see now how to access the elements of a vector. Accessing the elements of a vector or an array is important as it allows us to select, extract and even modify specific values or subsets of values from a vector. 2.5.1 Checking the size and dimension of a vector Before we access the elements of a vector or an array, it is useful to know the size and the dimension of the vector or the array. The size of a vector or an array is the number of elements that it contains. The dimension, on the other hand, is the number of axes or directions that it has. For example, a one-dimensional vector or array has only one axis or direction, and a two-dimensional vector or a matrix will have two axes or directions, such as rows and columns. To check the size and the dimension of a vector or an array in R and Python, we can use the following functions: In R, we can use the length function to get the size of a vector, and the dim function to get the dimension of a vector. R # Creating a vector of numbers x &lt;- 1:4 # Checking the size of the vector length(x) ## [1] 4 # Checking the dimension of the vector dim(x) ## NULL The length function returns the number of elements in the vector, which is 4, and the dim function returns NULL, which means that the vector has no dimension. This is because a vector in R is always one-dimensional, and the dim function is more useful for higher-dimensional objects, such as matrices or data frames. We will learn about these structures later on, so do not worry about it for now. In Python, we can use the size attribute or the len function to get the size of an array, and the shape attribute or the ndim attribute to get the dimension of an array. python # Creating an array of numbers x = np.arange(1, 4) # Checking the size of the array x.size ## 3 # 4 len(x) ## 3 # 4 # Checking the dimension of the array x.shape ## (3,) # (4,) x.ndim ## 1 # 1 The size attribute and the len function both return the number of elements in the array, which is 4, and the shape attribute and the ndim attribute both return the dimension of the array, which is 1. The shape attribute returns a tuple, that contains the length of each axis of the array, and the ndim attribute returns an integer that represents the number of axes of the array. Note that a one-dimensional array in Python has a shape of (n,), where n is the size of the array, and a comma is needed to indicate that it is a tuple. A tuple is another one dimentional structure in Python, but for now you can treat it as just a couple of numbers. 2.5.2 Accessing Vector Elements We can access the elements of the vector or the array by using indexing. Indexing is a way of referring to a specific element or a subset of elements of a vector or an array by using their position or location. Every element of a vector, in fact, has an index, that is a number that indicates its order in the vector. Indexing the elements of a vector or an array in R and Python has a fundamental difference that you need to be extremely careful about. R uses what is called one-based indexing, while Python uses zero-based indexing. This means that R starts counting the elements of a vector or an array from 1, e.g. the first element starts at one, while Python starts counting the elements of a vector or an array from 0. This difference can cause confusion and errors if you are not aware of it, so you need to pay attention to the indexing system of each language: R # The index will be # 1 2 3 4 x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) python # The index will be: # 0 1 2 3 x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) Let’s see how to practically access the single elements by using indexing. In R, the elements of a vector are indexed from 1 to the size of the vector, and we can use the square brackets [ ] to access them by using their index. # Accessing the first element of the vector x[1] ## [1] 1 # Accessing the last element of the vector x[length(x)] ## [1] 4 # Accessing any element of the vector x[3] ## [1] 3 The first element of the vector has an index of 1, the last element of the vector has an index of the size of the vector, which is 4. The square brackets [ ] are used to access the elements of the vector: therefore the index must be an integer between 1 and the size of the vector, otherwise it will produce an error or a missing value. In Python, the elements of an array are indexed from 0 to the size of the array minus 1, and we can use the square brackets [ ] to access them by using their index. # Accessing the first element of the array x[0] ## 1 # Accessing the last element of the array x[len(x) - 1] ## 4 # Accessing any element of the array x[2] ## 3 In Python, the first element of the array has an index of 0, the last element of the array has an index of the size of the array minus 1, which in our case is 3. The square brackets [ ] are used to access the elements of the array by using their index, and that the index must be an integer between 0 and the size of the array minus 1, otherwise it will produce an error or an out of bounds exception. Differently from R, in Python, however we can access the arrays from the back, using negative integers. Try: # Accessing the last element of the array x[-1] ## 4 # Accessing the second last element of the array x[-2] ## 3 # Accessing the first element of the array x[-len(x)] ## 1 2.5.2.1 Accessing multiple elements at once In addition to accessing a single element of a vector or an array, we can also access multiple elements at once by using indexing. This can be useful for selecting, modifying, or extracting specific values or subsets of values from a vector or an array. There are different ways to access multiple elements at once, depending on the criteria or the pattern that we want to use. To access any sequence of elements of a vector or an array, we can use sequences of integers as indices. This means we can use the colon operator : to create sequences of integers in R and Python, as we saw in the previous section, and use these to access and splice the first three elements, the last three elements, or even the even-indexed elements of a vector or an array (pun not intended). R # Creating a vector of the first 6 integers x &lt;- 1:6 # Accessing the first three elements of the vector x[1:3] ## [1] 1 2 3 # Accessing the last three elements of the vector # index is 4, 5, 6 x[(length(x) - 2):length(x)] ## [1] 4 5 6 # Accessing the even-indexed elements of the vector x[seq(from = 2, to = length(x), by = 2)] ## [1] 2 4 6 python # Creating an array of the first 6 integers x = np.arange(1, 7) # Accessing the first three elements of the array x[0:3] ## array([1, 2, 3]) # Accessing the last three elements of the array # index is 3, 4, 5 x[(len(x) - 3):len(x)] ## array([4, 5, 6]) # Accessing the even-indexed elements of the array x[np.arange(1, len(x), 2)] ## array([2, 4, 6]) Recall that R uses one-based indexing and Python uses zero-based indexing. The sequences of integers for accesing the indeces are created by using the colon operator : or the seq function in R, and the np.arange function in Python. The sequences of integers can have different start, end, or step values, depending on the desired subset of elements. Try to experiment a bit with the start and end values of the subsets introduced above! Similarly, we can use vectors or arrays of integers as indices to access multiple elements at every location. To do so, we will first create some vectors, and then use those vectors to access the elements of other vectors respectively. For example, we can access three elements at random of a vector or an array, as shown below: R # Accessing element 2, 5 and 6 of the vector x[c(2, 5, 6)] ## [1] 2 5 6 # note how in this way we can shuffle order! x[c(2, 6, 5)] ## [1] 2 6 5 python # Accessing element 2, 5 and 6 of the vector x[[1, 4, 5]] ## array([2, 5, 6]) # note how in this way we can shuffle order! x[[1, 5, 4]] ## array([2, 6, 5]) To access multiple elements at random of a vector or an array, we can also use vectors or arrays of booleans as indices. Vectors or arrays of booleans are collections of logical values, as introduced above, e.g. either TRUE or FALSE. In this case, it is important that the vectors or arrays of booleans have the same length as the vector or the array, and that only the elements that correspond to TRUE (in R) or True (in Python) values are selected. R # boolean index vector: # 2 5 6 index &lt;- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) # Accessing element 2, 5 and 6 of the vector x[index] ## [1] 2 5 6 python # boolean index vector: # 1 4 5 index = [False, True, False, False, True, True] # Accessing element 2, 5 and 6 of the vector x[index] ## array([2, 5, 6]) Why is this useful? Well, with this trick, we can use logical operators obtained by logical arithmetic to create vectors or arrays of booleans in R and Python. For example, we can access the elements that are greater than 3 of a vector or an array, as shown below: R # Creating a vector of numbers x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) # Accessing the elements that are greater than 3 of the vector x[x &gt; 3] ## [1] 4 5 6 # Accessing even elements x[x %% 2 == 0] ## [1] 2 4 6 python # Creating an array of numbers x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) # Accessing the elements that are greater than 3 of the array x[x &gt; 3] ## array([4, 5, 6]) # Accessing even elements x[x % 2 == 0] ## array([2, 4, 6]) 2.5.2.2 Overwriting elements of vectors Finally, as we can overwrite variables, we can overwrite single (or multiple!) elements of a vector without modifying the entire vector. This is essentially achieved by selecting the elements of interest, and then assigning new elements to those. The replacement, of course needs to be of the same length of the elements we wish to replace. If the new values are not compatible with the type and the length of the vector, both languages will produce an error or a warning. In R, we can use the square brackets [ ] to access the elements of the vector by using their index, and the left arrow &lt;- to assign new values to them. For example, to overwrite the first element, the last element, and the third element: R # Creating a vector of numbers x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) # Overwriting the first element of the vector x[1] &lt;- 10 x ## [1] 10 2 3 4 # Overwriting the last element of the vector x[length(x)] &lt;- 20 x ## [1] 10 2 3 20 # Overwriting any element of the vector x[3] &lt;- 30 x ## [1] 10 2 30 20 In Python, we can use the square brackets [ ] to access the elements of the array by using their index, and the equal sign = to assign new values to them. For example, to overwrite the first element, the last element, and third element: python # Creating an array of numbers x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) # Overwriting the first element of the array x[0] = 10 x ## array([10, 2, 3, 4]) # Overwriting the last element of the array x[len(x) - 1] = 20 x ## array([10, 2, 3, 20]) # Overwriting any element of the array x[2] = 30 x ## array([10, 2, 30, 20]) In this code, the square brackets [ ] are used to access the elements of the array by using their index, and the equal sign = is used to assign new values to them Note that the final vector has the three elements we accessed all changed. As mentioned, we can select and replace multiple elements simultaneously in a single command, look for instance at the code below. 2.5.2.3 Exercise: vector fizzbuzz You are ready to see your first complex program. Can you tell what it does? Break down, comment and describe the following code, and adapt it do perform Skibbidifizzbuzz. R x &lt;- 1:100 fizz_index &lt;- x %% 3 == 0 buzz_index &lt;- x %% 5 == 0 x[fizz_index] &lt;- &quot;fizz&quot; x[buzz_index] &lt;- &quot;buzz&quot; x[fizz_index &amp; buzz_index] &lt;- &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; x ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [7] &quot;7&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;11&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [13] &quot;13&quot; &quot;14&quot; &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; &quot;16&quot; &quot;17&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [19] &quot;19&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;22&quot; &quot;23&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [25] &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;26&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;28&quot; &quot;29&quot; &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; ## [31] &quot;31&quot; &quot;32&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;34&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [37] &quot;37&quot; &quot;38&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;41&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [43] &quot;43&quot; &quot;44&quot; &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; &quot;46&quot; &quot;47&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [49] &quot;49&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;52&quot; &quot;53&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [55] &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;56&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;58&quot; &quot;59&quot; &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; ## [61] &quot;61&quot; &quot;62&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;64&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [67] &quot;67&quot; &quot;68&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;71&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [73] &quot;73&quot; &quot;74&quot; &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; &quot;76&quot; &quot;77&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [79] &quot;79&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;82&quot; &quot;83&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [85] &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;86&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;88&quot; &quot;89&quot; &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; ## [91] &quot;91&quot; &quot;92&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;94&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; ## [97] &quot;97&quot; &quot;98&quot; &quot;fizz&quot; &quot;buzz&quot; python x = np.arange(1, 101, dtype=object) fizz_index = x % 3 == 0 buzz_index = x % 5 == 0 x[fizz_index] = &quot;fizz&quot; x[buzz_index] = &quot;buzz&quot; x[np.logical_and(fizz_index, buzz_index)] = &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; x ## array([1, 2, &#39;fizz&#39;, 4, &#39;buzz&#39;, &#39;fizz&#39;, 7, 8, &#39;fizz&#39;, &#39;buzz&#39;, 11, &#39;fizz&#39;, ## 13, 14, &#39;fizzbuzz&#39;, 16, 17, &#39;fizz&#39;, 19, &#39;buzz&#39;, &#39;fizz&#39;, 22, 23, ## &#39;fizz&#39;, &#39;buzz&#39;, 26, &#39;fizz&#39;, 28, 29, &#39;fizzbuzz&#39;, 31, 32, &#39;fizz&#39;, 34, ## &#39;buzz&#39;, &#39;fizz&#39;, 37, 38, &#39;fizz&#39;, &#39;buzz&#39;, 41, &#39;fizz&#39;, 43, 44, ## &#39;fizzbuzz&#39;, 46, 47, &#39;fizz&#39;, 49, &#39;buzz&#39;, &#39;fizz&#39;, 52, 53, &#39;fizz&#39;, ## &#39;buzz&#39;, 56, &#39;fizz&#39;, 58, 59, &#39;fizzbuzz&#39;, 61, 62, &#39;fizz&#39;, 64, &#39;buzz&#39;, ## &#39;fizz&#39;, 67, 68, &#39;fizz&#39;, &#39;buzz&#39;, 71, &#39;fizz&#39;, 73, 74, &#39;fizzbuzz&#39;, 76, ## 77, &#39;fizz&#39;, 79, &#39;buzz&#39;, &#39;fizz&#39;, 82, 83, &#39;fizz&#39;, &#39;buzz&#39;, 86, &#39;fizz&#39;, ## 88, 89, &#39;fizzbuzz&#39;, 91, 92, &#39;fizz&#39;, 94, &#39;buzz&#39;, &#39;fizz&#39;, 97, 98, ## &#39;fizz&#39;, &#39;buzz&#39;], dtype=object) Small hint: You should be careful about the type of output vector in R. You’ll notice now it’s a character vector. Python does not convert the type of vector automatically, the dtype argument is needed to ensure the vector can contain both integers and strings. Remove the dtype argument from the first line and see what happens. .book .book-body .page-wrapper .page-inner { max-width: 1200px !important; } "],["func_loop.html", "3 Functions and Loops 3.1 Functions 3.2 State and For Loop 3.3 More about looping", " 3 Functions and Loops 3.1 Functions Functions in mathematics, is an assignment of an element from a set to a different set. Here we give a more “practical” definition. In the realm of programming, a function is a reusable piece of code that performs a specific task. Think of it as a mini-program within your program, a tool you create to do a job so you don’t have to. And as a program does, you give it an input, it will do some voudou magic, and it will spit an output. What’s the point of a function you might ask? Well, in programming, we use functions when we have tasks that must be performed again and again. When we notice a repetitive task occurring, it is a good idea to write a function that performs this task. If you find yourself copying and pasting the same piece of code more than three times, it’s time to stop and think: “Should I write a function for this?” Remember, in the world of coding, being lazy is often a good thing! We aim for efficiency, not repetitive strain injury. Imagine if every time you need to compute the square root, you need to write the code to compute the square root over and over again. Well, but in practice, you don’t have to! There’s a function that does the job for you already: sqrt In fact, it won’t come as a surprise that we’ve already encountered many functions in the past weeks. For instance: Mathematical functions like sqrt() or sin() in R, and math.sqrt() or math.sin() in Python. Functions like np.array() or c() to create vectors. Functions like length() in R or len() in Python to get information about our data structures. Again, each function I mentioned, has an input, and an output: sqrt takes a number as input and returns the square root of such number, length or len take a whole vector as input, and return the length of it… Another incredibly useful function is the help() function, available in both R and Python. This function takes a function as an input, and provides us with information said function as output! For example: R help(sqrt) python help(math.sqrt) Whenever you will meet a built-in function, or a function from a documented external library you can call the help on the function to have an explanation about it! Documentation is a requirement in R libraries, so pretty much all the functions you will meet are documented! Unfortunately this is not the case for Python, where documenting functions is not a requirement, so not always the help will return something. 3.1.1 Writing new functions The real power of functions comes when we start creating our own. We can write new functions that perform specific tasks, tailored to our needs. This allows us to do more complex, interesting, and fun things with our code. So let’s dive in and learn how to create our own functions! We can wrap our code in a function, and every time the function is called, this code is run. This is incredibly useful for tasks we need to perform multiple times. Let’s build for example a simple function that converts pounds (lbs) to grams (g). Mathematically, this is simply done by the formula: \\[ g = 453.5924 * lbs \\] In R, we define a function using the function() command. The arguments of the function are placed within the parentheses. Here’s how we can create a function in R: lbs_to_grams &lt;- function(lbs) { grams &lt;- 453.5924 * lbs return(grams) } In this function, lbs is the input (or argument), and the function returns the equivalent weight in grams. In R, we create a new function with the function statement, and then we assign it to a variable, which is going to be containing our function. The return() statement is used to specify the result that the function should output. In Python, we define a function using the def keyword. The arguments of the function are placed within the parentheses. Again we need to use indentation: this is crucial in Python as it determines the code blocks. Here’s how we can create a function in Python: def lbs_to_grams(lbs): grams = 453.5924 * lbs return grams In this function, lbs is the input (or argument), and the function returns the equivalent weight in grams: following the def keyword we need both the function name, followed by the argument. The return statement is used to specify the result that the function should output. Now, once we have made the new function, we can call it with: R lbs_to_grams(lbs=2) ## [1] 907.1848 lbs_to_grams(lbs=3) ## [1] 1360.777 # when calling we can also omit # the argument name for brevity lbs_to_grams(3) ## [1] 1360.777 python lbs_to_grams(lbs=2) ## 907.1848 lbs_to_grams(lbs=3) ## 1360.7772 # when calling we can also omit # the argument name for brevity lbs_to_grams(3) ## 1360.7772 By creating functions like these, we can make our code more efficient and easier to read. Plus, it saves us from having to remember the conversion rate each time we want to convert pounds to grams! The name of the function lbs_to_grams and its argument lbs are just names that I chose. There are a few guidelines that could be useful when naming functions: - Names should be lowercase. - Use an underscore, _, to separate words within a name. - Strive for names that are concise and meaningful (this is not easy!). - Avoid existing function names in R and python, such as length() or len(). Also, you might have noticed we made a variable within the function code, grams. But what does it mean to have variables within functions? The variables used inside a function are local to that function. Think of your function as a guarded sandbox, where no child leaves unless you specifically tell them to. This sandbox is called and enviroment. Let’s cover this concept formally! 3.1.1.1 Enviroments In programming, an environment refers to a structure that holds variables. When you create a variable in a program, the environment is where this variable lives. The environment keeps track of the variable’s name and its current value. There are two types of environments: global and local. The global environment is the default environment where your variables live unless you specify otherwise. When you create a variable at the top level of your script, it’s stored in the global environment. A local environment is created when you call a function. Each time a function is called, a new local environment is created for that function call. This environment holds the variables that are created within the function. These variables are only accessible within the function call and cease to exist once the function call is over. Let’s consider the lbs_to_grams function we made: R lbs_to_grams &lt;- function(lbs) { grams = 453.5924 * lbs return(grams) } # Create a variable in the global environment glo_grams &lt;- 2 # Try to access the local variable &quot;grams&quot; print(grams) ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;grams&#39; not found # Try to access the global variable &quot;glo_grams&quot; print(glo_grams) ## [1] 2 python def lbs_to_grams(lbs): grams = 453.5924 * lbs return grams # Create a variable in the global environment glo_grams = 2 # Try to access the local variable &quot;grams&quot; print(grams) ## name &#39;grams&#39; is not defined # Try to access the global variable &quot;glo_grams&quot; print(glo_grams) ## 2 In these functions, lbs and grams are variables in the local environment of the function. They are created when the function is called and cease to exist when the function call is over. If you try to access grams outside of the function, you’ll get an error because grams is not in the global environment. On the other hand, glo_grams is in the global environment because it’s created at the top level of the script, not within a function. You can access glo_grams anywhere in your script even within a function. This distinction between global and local variables helps keep our code clean and reduces the chance of errors. It ensures that the function does its job without interfering with the rest of our script! However, it can be prone to errors too. Say for instance, I make a typo in the argument name of my function above, and, for whatever reason I created a lbs variable in the global… Like for instance: R # I specified in the global lbs at some point lbs &lt;- 3 # and here I made a typo! # V bug_lbs_to_grams &lt;- function(lb) { grams = 453.5924 * lbs return(grams) } # Then, no matter what I call, I will always get the same result! # e.g.: 453.5924 * 3 bug_lbs_to_grams(2) ## [1] 1360.777 bug_lbs_to_grams(10) ## [1] 1360.777 bug_lbs_to_grams(42) ## [1] 1360.777 python # I specified in the global lbs at some point lbs = 3 # and here I made a typo! # V def bug_lbs_to_grams(lb): grams = 453.5924 * lbs return grams # Then, no matter what I call, I will always get the same result! # e.g.: 453.5924 * 3 bug_lbs_to_grams(2) ## 1360.7772 bug_lbs_to_grams(10) ## 1360.7772 bug_lbs_to_grams(42) ## 1360.7772 What happened above, is that I pass down as an input the lb argument (without the s) but this is nowhere used in the function as inside the code, at grams = 453.5924 * lbs I call the lbs. Now since the compiler can’t find any lbs within the local enviroment, it will just assume that this is the lbs I specified in the global. Hence, no matter what I feed to the function, it will return the evaluation with the global lbs. For this reason try not to name the variables inside your functions as those outside it, in the rest of your script. What happens if I do name a local variable and global variable in the same way? Well, in this case, the function will use the local lbs variable, and the global will use the global lbs variable but this is still risky and prone to bugs. R # global lbs lbs &lt;- 3 # but this does not affect the &quot;lbs&quot; of the function argument lbs_to_grams(2) ## [1] 907.1848 lbs_to_grams(10) ## [1] 4535.924 lbs_to_grams(42) ## [1] 19050.88 python # global lbs lbs = 3 # but this does not affect the &quot;lbs&quot; of the function argument lbs_to_grams(2) ## 907.1848 lbs_to_grams(10) ## 4535.924 lbs_to_grams(42) ## 19050.8808 3.1.1.2 Multiple arguments Say we want now to convert pounds to milliliters. To convert from mass to volume, we will need an additional information, the specific mass. In physics, the specific mass (also known as the volumetric mass density) of a substance is the mass per unit volume. Fortunately for us, functions can take multiple arguments, allowing us to give more elements to the local environment of the function. This means we can customize the function’s behavior based on these inputs. Let’s see how we can add more arguments to a function. We’ll create a new function to convert pounds to milliliters. This function will take a second argument: specific_mass. We’ll use the function we created earlier to convert pounds to grams, and then, using the specific_mass, we’ll convert grams to liters. Here’s how we can do this in both R and Python: R lbs_to_ml &lt;- function(lbs, specific_mass) { grams &lt;- lbs_to_grams(lbs) ml &lt;- grams / specific_mass return(ml) } # Specific mass of water and oil water_mass = 1 oil_mass = 0.92 # Convert 2 lbs of water and oil to ml lbs_to_ml(2, water_mass) ## [1] 907.1848 lbs_to_ml(2, oil_mass) ## [1] 986.0704 python def lbs_to_ml(lbs, specific_mass): grams = lbs_to_grams(lbs) ml = grams / specific_mass return ml # Specific mass of water and oil water_mass = 1 oil_mass = 0.92 # Convert 2 lbs of water and oil to ml lbs_to_ml(2, water_mass) ## 907.1848 lbs_to_ml(2, oil_mass) ## 986.0704347826087 To run the functions we just made: R # Specific mass of water and oil water_mass = 1 oil_mass = 0.92 # Convert 2 lbs of water and oil to ml lbs_to_ml(2, specific_mass=water_mass) ## [1] 907.1848 lbs_to_ml(2, specific_mass=oil_mass) ## [1] 986.0704 python # Specific mass of water and oil water_mass = 1 oil_mass = 0.92 # Convert 2 lbs of water and oil to ml lbs_to_ml(2, specific_mass=water_mass) ## 907.1848 lbs_to_ml(2, specific_mass=oil_mass) ## 986.0704347826087 Let’s say that 90% of the time when we are doing these calculations, they are relative to using water. Then, to be more efficient, rather than continuously having to give the mass of water, we could set the arguments to have these as default values. This is where default arguments in functions come into play. They are incredibly useful for several reasons: They allow us to make certain parameters optional, which can make the function easier to use. They can provide sensible defaults for a function, allowing it to be used without requiring the user to specify every single parameter. They can make the code more readable by clearly stating what the default behavior of the function is. Here’s how we can do this in both R and Python: R lbs_to_ml &lt;- function(lbs, specific_weight = 1) { grams &lt;- lbs_to_grams(lbs) ml &lt;- grams / specific_weight return(ml) } # Convert 2 lbs of water to ml (default behavior) lbs_to_ml(2) ## [1] 907.1848 # Convert 2 lbs of oil to ml (specific behavior) lbs_to_ml(2, 0.92) ## [1] 986.0704 python def lbs_to_ml(lbs, specific_weight=1): grams = lbs_to_grams(lbs) ml = grams / specific_weight return ml # Convert 2 lbs of water to ml (default behavior) lbs_to_ml(2) ## 907.1848 # Convert 2 lbs of oil to ml (specific behavior) lbs_to_ml(2, 0.92) ## 986.0704347826087 As you can see, default arguments make our function more flexible and easier to use. They allow the function to handle a wider range of scenarios while keeping the code clean and readable. 3.1.2 Exercise: cups to grams converter So I once watched this movie with a small rat chef named Remy. Like it’s a very popular one, but I can’t say the title for copyright reasons. Anyway, let’s say that one day, Remy decides to leave his home in France and set sail for the culinary world of the United States. But as soon as Remy gets onto American soil, and he starts to explore American recipes, he encounters a problem. All the measurements are in cups! Back in France, he was used to grams and liters. “Mon Dieu!” he exclaimed, “How am I supposed to cook with these cup measurements?” [Imagine this phrase with a French accent]. But Remy is not a rat to be easily defeated: To make his life easier, he decides to hire a programmer on Fiverr to convert cups to grams. You are that programmer. As we did with the functions we created before, you should: Create a new function cups_to_ml that takes as input the number of cups and returns as output the corresponding value in milliliters. Use the relation \\[ cps = 236.588 * ml \\] Create a new function called ml_to_grams. This function, as above, will need the specific weight, but now the relation is given by the inverse: \\[ g = ml * \\rho, \\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the specific weight. Create a last function called cups_to_ml. This function should: Take as input two arguments: the number of cups, and a string that specifies an ingredient, e.g. \"flour\" or \"water\". Default this second argument to water. Convert the amount of cups in milliliters using the function cups_to_ml. With an if-if else-else statement, it should check the argument ingredient, and set a specific_weight variable based on the ingredient. You can find the values in the table below: Ingredient Specific Weight (g/ml) water 1 flour 0.53 oil 0.92 oat Milk 1.03 Call the ml_to_grams function with the relative ml and specific weight computed above, and return the result. Run the function to convert the following: 2 cups of water Half a cup of oil 3 cups of oat milk 2 cups of flour plus one cup of water 3.2 State and For Loop Normally, if you have to run some operations on multiple objects, you would store these objects in a vector, and then work with the vector directly. This is what we’ve been doing in the past weeks, and what works for most of the times. For instance, let’s say we have a vector called measurements in lbs and we want to convert all these measurements to grams. Then, we can simply take our function lbs_to_grams we made above, and run it on the measurements vector: R # Create a vector of measurements in lbs measurements &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) # Convert measurements to grams lbs_to_grams(measurements) ## [1] 453.5924 907.1848 1360.7772 python # importing numpy import numpy as np # Create a list of measurements in lbs measurements = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # Convert measurements to grams lbs_to_grams(measurements) ## array([ 453.5924, 907.1848, 1360.7772]) This will run the function on each element of the vector independently. More formally: in the first two weeks, we learned how to work with vectors and vectorised functions, designed to operate on whole vectors directly. Technically, we say that vectorised functions are trivially parallelizable because there’s no dependency between elements (the value of an element of the output vector does not depend on any other element). However, while you should use vectorised functions as much as you can, they are not suitable for all programming tasks, particularly when the computation of an element depends on the previous ones, i.e., when there is a state involved. A state is a scenario where certain steps in your code must be executed in a specific order because the output of one step is the input to the next step. In these circumstances, we find an answer in looping. Loops allow us to execute a block of code multiple times, which is exactly what we want in these scenarios. The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a state. If you’re not familiar with it, the Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The first 10 values in the series will be: This table shows the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, starting from \\(r_{0}\\) to \\(r_{9}\\). \\(r_{i}\\) \\(r_{0}\\) \\(r_{1}\\) \\(r_{2}\\) \\(r_{3}\\) \\(r_{4}\\) \\(r_{5}\\) \\(r_{6}\\) \\(r_{7}\\) \\(r_{8}\\) \\(r_{9}\\) Value 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 More formally, the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation: \\[ r_{i} = r_{i - 1} + r_{i - 2} \\quad \\text{for}\\quad i &gt; 2, \\] with initial conditions \\(r_{1} = 0\\) and \\(r_{2} = 1\\). Well, unsurprisingly, in mathematics, you have already met the “for” statements! As in mathematics a “for” allows to build a relation, a “for” loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly. Therefore, to generate the Fibonacci sequence using a “for” loop, we could use the following algorithm: Start by defining the first two numbers in the sequence, 0 and 1. For a given number of iterations, do the following: Calculate the next number in the sequence as the sum of the previous two numbers. Update the previous two numbers to be the last number and the newly calculated number. We will return to the Fibonacci example after having introduced the for loop syntax. 3.2.1 The syntax As the syntax in R and python for looping is quite different, R and python chunks will be separate. You should be able to read each language independently. We can code a for loop as following. In R: for (i in 1:10) { print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 ## [1] 6 ## [1] 7 ## [1] 8 ## [1] 9 ## [1] 10 In this R code, to explain the syntax: for (i in 1:10) is the start of the for loop. The iterator i goes from 1 to 10. 1:10 creates a vector: this is the sequence of values we want to iterate over. print(i) is the code chunk that we want to repeat. In this case it prints the current value of i. i is the object that stores our current index. It gets updated at each step over the sequence of values for 1 to 10. The for loop ends when it has exhausted the sequence, i.e., when i has taken all values from 1 to 10. We can also use the for loop to iterate over the elements of a vector directly, rather than their indices. For example, a for loop that prints the elements of a vector: vec &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;) for (fruit in vec) { print(fruit) } ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; ## [1] &quot;banana&quot; ## [1] &quot;cherry&quot; In this case, fruit is the iterator that gets updated at each step over the sequence with the current element of the sequence. The for loop ends when it has exhausted the sequence. In Python: In Python, we can print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop as follows: for i in range(1, 11): print(i) ## 1 ## 2 ## 3 ## 4 ## 5 ## 6 ## 7 ## 8 ## 9 ## 10 In this Python code, to explain the syntax: for i in range(1, 11) is the start of the for loop. The iterator i goes from 1 to 10. This is the sequence we want to iterate over. We use range function to generate this figure: this function is analogue to np.arange from numpy, but generates a different object called “range” that is specific to iterators print(i) is the code chunk that we want to repeat. It prints the current value of i. i is the object that stores our current index. It gets updated at each step over the sequence. The for loop ends when it has exhausted the sequence, i.e., when i has taken all values from 1 to 10. We can also use the for loop to iterate over the elements of a numpy array directly, rather than their indices. For example, a for loop that prints the elements of a numpy array: arr = np.array([&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;]) for fruit in arr: print(fruit) ## apple ## banana ## cherry In this Python code: arr = np.array([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]) creates a numpy array with the elements “apple”, “banana”, and “cherry”. for fruit in arr: is the start of the for loop. The iterator fruit goes over each element in the numpy array arr. print(fruit) is the code chunk that we want to repeat. It prints the current value of fruit. fruit is the object that stores the current element of the array. It gets updated at each step over the sequence. The for loop ends when it has exhausted the sequence, i.e., when fruit has taken all values in the numpy array arr. 3.2.2 Coding The Fibonacci sequence Having covered how to write a for cycle, we come back to our Fibonacci example: R # Initialize the first two numbers in the sequence fibonacci &lt;- c(0, 1) # Generate the next 18 numbers in the sequence for (i in 3:20) { fibonacci[i] &lt;- fibonacci[i - 1] + fibonacci[i - 2] } Python # Initialize the first two numbers in the sequence fibonacci = [0, 1] # Generate the next 18 numbers in the sequence for i in range(2, 20): fibonacci.append(fibonacci[i - 1] + fibonacci[i - 2]) # converting the list into a numpy array # (useful if we want to use vectorised operations later!) fibonacci = np.array(fibonacci) In the R code: fibonacci &lt;- c(0, 1) initializes the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. for (i in 3:20) is the start of the for loop. The iterator i goes from 3 to 20. This is the sequence we want to iterate over. fibonacci[i] &lt;- fibonacci[i - 1] + fibonacci[i - 2] is the code chunk that we want to repeat. It calculates the ith number in the Fibonacci sequence as the sum of the two preceding numbers and appends it to the fibonacci vector. Given that at iteration i we have no element i in the vector yet (this is still i-1 long), R will automatically extend the vector of one extra element. In the Python code: fibonacci = [0, 1] initializes the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. for i in range(2, 20) is the start of the for loop. The iterator i goes from 2 to 19. This is the sequence we want to iterate over. fibonacci.append(fibonacci[i - 1] + fibonacci[i - 2]) is the code chunk that we want to repeat. It calculates the ith number in the Fibonacci sequence as the sum of the two preceding numbers and appends it to the fibonacci list using the append() method. The append method extends our vector, adding a new element at the end of the existing one. Our vectors, where we stored our results at every iteration, should be 20 elements long, containing the sequence. ::: {style=“display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;”} R # Print the Fibonacci sequence print(fibonacci) ## [1] 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 ## [16] 610 987 1597 2584 4181 Python # Print the Fibonacci sequence print(fibonacci) ## [ 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 ## 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181] ::: Before you proceed make sure you understand what’s going on inside the for loop. Add extra print statements to understand what’s happening at every iteration, e.g. try to add: print(i), print(fibonacci[i]) and print(fibonacci[i-1]) before the computation, or print(fibonacci) after the computation has been done. print statements are extremely useful for debugging for cycles! 3.3 More about looping In this section we will be giving few extra details and concepts you should know about looping. If you got familiar with the for cycle above, they should be fairly straightforward to understand! 3.3.1 Nested loops Nested loops are useful when we have to repeat a block of code for each combination of elements from two or more sequences. This can be incredibly useful in many situations, such as when we want to perform an operation for each pair of elements in two lists or vectors. A simple example, for instance, could be a nested loop that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 4. R for (i in 1:4) { for (j in 1:4) { print(paste(i, &quot;x&quot;, j, &quot;=&quot;, i*j)) } } ## [1] &quot;1 x 1 = 1&quot; ## [1] &quot;1 x 2 = 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;1 x 3 = 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;1 x 4 = 4&quot; ## [1] &quot;2 x 1 = 2&quot; ## [1] &quot;2 x 2 = 4&quot; ## [1] &quot;2 x 3 = 6&quot; ## [1] &quot;2 x 4 = 8&quot; ## [1] &quot;3 x 1 = 3&quot; ## [1] &quot;3 x 2 = 6&quot; ## [1] &quot;3 x 3 = 9&quot; ## [1] &quot;3 x 4 = 12&quot; ## [1] &quot;4 x 1 = 4&quot; ## [1] &quot;4 x 2 = 8&quot; ## [1] &quot;4 x 3 = 12&quot; ## [1] &quot;4 x 4 = 16&quot; Python for i in range(1, 5): for j in range(1, 5): print(f&quot;{i} x {j} = {i*j}&quot;) ## 1 x 1 = 1 ## 1 x 2 = 2 ## 1 x 3 = 3 ## 1 x 4 = 4 ## 2 x 1 = 2 ## 2 x 2 = 4 ## 2 x 3 = 6 ## 2 x 4 = 8 ## 3 x 1 = 3 ## 3 x 2 = 6 ## 3 x 3 = 9 ## 3 x 4 = 12 ## 4 x 1 = 4 ## 4 x 2 = 8 ## 4 x 3 = 12 ## 4 x 4 = 16 3.3.2 While loops Similarly to for loops, we have the while loops. They allow us to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. This can be incredibly useful in many situations, such as when we want to perform an operation until a certain threshold is reached. We can see how a while loop works below: R i &lt;- 1 while (i &lt;= 10) { print(i) i &lt;- i + 1 } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 ## [1] 6 ## [1] 7 ## [1] 8 ## [1] 9 ## [1] 10 Python i = 1 while i &lt;= 10: print(i) i += 1 ## 1 ## 2 ## 3 ## 4 ## 5 ## 6 ## 7 ## 8 ## 9 ## 10 In these codes: i &lt;- 1 and i = 1 initialize the counter at 1. while (i &lt;= 10) and while i &lt;= 10: start the while loop. The condition i &lt;= 10 is what we check at each step. If it’s true, we execute the code chunk inside the loop. print(i) and print(i) are the code chunks that we want to repeat. They print the current value of i. i &lt;- i + 1 and i += 1 are crucial. They update i at each step, ensuring that our condition will eventually be false. Without these lines, i would always be 1, the condition would always be true, and the while loop would run indefinitely. The while loop ends when the condition i &lt;= 10 is no longer met, i.e., when i is greater than 10. 3.3.3 Break and next We are missing one last ingredient to looping! Break and next. 3.3.4 Break and next/continue Break and next/continue are control flow statements that can be used to alter the flow of a loop. They can be incredibly useful in many situations, such as when we want to stop a loop if a certain condition is met or skip an iteration if a certain condition is met. To see how they work, we write a loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, but skips the number 5 and stops after the number 8. R for (i in 1:10) { if (i == 5) { next # Skip the rest of the loop # and continue with the next iteration } if (i &gt; 8) { break # Immediately terminate the loop } print(i) # Print the current value of i } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 6 ## [1] 7 ## [1] 8 Python for i in range(1, 11): if i == 5: continue # Skip the rest of the loop # and continue with the next iteration if i &gt; 8: break # Immediately terminate the loop print(i) # Print the current value of i ## 1 ## 2 ## 3 ## 4 ## 6 ## 7 ## 8 Let’s break it down: if (i == 5) { next } (R) and if i == 5: continue (python) are the next/continue statements. If i is equal to 5, they skip the rest of the loop and continue with the next iteration. 5 won’t be printed! if (i &gt; 8) { break } and if i &gt; 8: break are the break statements. If i is greater than 8, they immediately terminate the loop, regardless of the loop condition. As a result, we stop at 8, and don’t continue to up to 10. break could be an alternative stopping condition to a while loop. .book .book-body .page-wrapper .page-inner { max-width: 1200px !important; } "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

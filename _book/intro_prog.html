<p>The boss was passing by, so they minimized the browser with the useless Instagram tab and found themselves staring at an Excel window. They had spent hours working on this spreadsheet, crunching pointless numbers and averages. They felt exhausted and bored. They looked at the grid of the spreadsheet, and felt like they were behind the bars of a prison. They wondered if this was what computing was supposed to be like.</p>
<p>They had loved mathematics once, and wanted to learn how to use it in creative and exciting ways. They wanted to explore new and emerging fields, such as data science, machine learning, AI, cryptography, share their code and results online. Well, too late now.</p>
<p>They wished that back in uni there was a course that could teach them the basics and fundamentals of programming, and show them how to use two of the most popular and powerful languages for scientific computing: R and Python.</p>
<p>Oh, what…</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/skyrim-finally-awake.jpg" width="547" /></p>
<p>Welcome to MATH245, Computational Mathematics! In this course, you will learn how to use two of the most popular and powerful programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. You will also learn a bunch of cool algorithms and how to apply them to various mathematical problems.</p>
<p>Why should you learn programming in mathematics? Well, there are many reasons, but few that could be of interest to you are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>This is a mandatory module. You need to learn how to program to pass. Sometimes life is harsh, we know.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes you will face in computing some problems that are simply too hard to solve by hand. Can’t digest that integral? That ODE is beating up your little brother in school for lunch money?<br />
<em>Well, with a computer those will not be a problem anymore.</em> You will learn how to perform complex and large-scale calculations and simulations that would be impossible or impractical by hand or with a calculator.</p></li>
<li><p>Programming is the butter to the bread of these emerging fields of mathematics, such as machine learning, statistical learning, data science and artificial intelligence. Do you want to convert your grandma into a robot? Gottcha, you’ll need to know what a neural network is. And likely what stochastic gradient descent is, we will cover that. <em>Oh, and you need to know how to program.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Oh, nice Bayesian nested model you got here. It would be a shame if there was not a closed form… What? Your data set has three-thousand features? Well, <em>modern statistics is done behind a computer.</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In short, programming can make mathematics more fun, more useful, and more relevant to the modern world. As a mathematician in the 21st century, you need to be able to work with a computer and use it as a tool for discovery and innovation.</p>
<p>And well, don’t worry if you have no prior knowledge of programming. We will start from the basics, like really the basics basics, as you can see from the next section header. We will then guide you through the fundamentals and concepts of programming, and then will follow through the basics of Computational Mathematics and Algorithms. We will also give you plenty of examples and exercises to practice and test your skills. By the end of this course, you will be able to write and run your own code in both R and Python, which are two of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing, and learn very useful algorithms that you will apply to various mathematical problems.</p>

<p>Few years ago Apple came up with yet another iPad. And with that, another of their ads. In that one a kid would do a bunch of things around with an iPad pro, kinda like working on Word or drawing silly things. Then, at the end, a peeping neighbor, perhaps too curious, would ask them: <em>“Wattcha doing on your computer?”</em>. To which the kid, holding the iPad, replies: <em>“What’s a computer?”</em>. Here, look for yourself:</p>

<p>Well, you silly! Your iPad is a computer. So it’s your smartphone. And your smartwatch, probably your TV, your Fridge and your car - if you have a fancy electric car. We’re living in a world of computers.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of computers, but you have probably interacted mostly with smartphones and desktop or laptop computers. As a student of in this module, you will likely use a desktop (the university machine) or your own laptop for programming. Theoretically, however, you can also program on other devices, such as tablets (or smartwatches, even!), obviously with some caveats and limitations.<br />
Also, computers will have different architectures, such as x86, ARM, or RISC-V, that determine how they processes the instructions and data. You might not know it, but your laptop could have a mobile processor, like the such as Snapdragon, Exynos, or Apple M-series. <strong>This could impact your learning experience in this module, so, if you are not familiar with the concept above stick to the university machines.</strong></p>
<p>More formally, a computer is a device that can perform calculations and manipulate data, all by following a set of instructions known as a program. It has the ability to process a variety of data types, including numbers, text, images, sound, and video, and can produce a range of outputs. This could be anything from displaying information on a screen, playing audio, or transmitting information over the internet (which, in its simplest form, is just two computers exchanging text).</p>
<p>Let's delve a bit deeper into the main components of a computer:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong>: Often referred to as the 'brain' of the computer, the CPU is responsible for executing the program's instructions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory</strong>: This is the computer's short-term memory, sometimes known as <strong>RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong>. It stores the data that the CPU needs to access quickly and frequently. RAM is volatile, which means that its contents are lost when the computer is turned off or restarted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Storage</strong>: This is the computer's long-term memory. It holds data that isn't required immediately or frequently by the CPU. This could include the program itself or files created by the user. Hard drives are non-volatile, meaning their contents persist even when the computer is turned off.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To illustrate how these components interact, let's consider what happens when you run a program e.g. a series of instruction that make sense to your CPU:</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/architecture.png" width="522" /></p>
<p>Say that your program and your data are saved on your hard drive (a type of storage). The program, along with any necessary data, is then loaded from the hard drive into the memory. This allows the CPU to access it. The CPU then carries out the program's instructions, performing calculations and operations on the data stored in the memory. The results of these operations remain in the memory and can be displayed on the screen, saved back to the hard drive, or sent to another device. This process highlights the integral role each component plays in the functioning of a computer.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Computer Programs and Programming Languages<a href="intro_prog.html#computer-programs-and-programming-languages" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We have mentioned a program earlier, but what is a program? A program is a sequence of instructions that tells the computer what to do. A program can be written in different ways, depending on the level of abstraction and the intended audience. For example, a program can be written in natural language, such as English, or in a formal language, such as mathematics. However, the computer cannot understand these languages directly. It can only understand a very low-level language, called machine code, which consists of binary digits (0s and 1s) that represent the basic operations of the CPU. We call this set of binary instructions <strong>a computer program</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/chapter1/chad_pc.png" width="546" /></p>
<p>Therefore, to make the computer execute a program, we need to translate it from a higher-level language to a lower-level language. This is where programming languages come in. A programming language is a formal language that defines the syntax and semantics of a program. A programming language allows us to write programs in a more human-readable and expressive way, and then convert them to machine code that the computer can understand and execute.</p>
<p>There are many programming languages, and they have different features and purposes. Some programming languages are designed for specific domains or tasks, such as web development, data analysis, or game design. Some programming languages are more general-purpose and can be used for a variety of applications. Some programming languages are more popular and widely used than others, depending on the trends and demands of the industry and the community.</p>
<p>In this course, we will focus on two of the most popular and versatile programming languages for scientific computing: R and Python. Both of these languages are high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>High-level</strong> means that the programming language is closer to natural language and more abstracted from the details of the machine code. This makes the language easier to read, write, and understand, but also requires more translation and processing by the interpreter or the compiler. But don’t worry about this… Fortunately most of the heavy lifting is done by the compiler, which is the interpreter that converts the code from human readable to machine readable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpreted</strong> means that the programming language does not need to be compiled before execution, but rather is translated and executed line by line by a program called an interpreter. This allows the language to be more dynamic and flexible, but also slower and less efficient than compiled languages. One of the advantages of interpreted languages is that you can execute commands <strong>directly in the console</strong>, in addition to writing and saving these in a script. This is useful for testing and debugging your code, or for performing quick calculations and operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General-purpose</strong> means that the programming language can be used for a variety of applications and domains, and is not limited to a specific purpose or task. This makes the language more versatile and adaptable, but also less specialized and optimized than domain-specific languages. General-purpose languages can be used for web development, video game engineering, automation, and… Scientific computing, among other things.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Well, finally it’s time to introduce our two friends. And as with any good introduction, we give a bit of history.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong> is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in 1993. It is based on the S language, which was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and others in the 1970s. R is free and open source, and has a large and active community of users and developers. R is especially popular among statisticians, data scientists, and researchers in various fields.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong> is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It was created by Max Verstappen in the Netherlands 5 years ago. Nah, just kidding… It was made though in the Netherlands in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI). It is named after the comedy group Monty Python, and has a philosophy of simplicity, readability, and elegance. Python is also free and open source, and has a huge and diverse community of users and developers. Python is widely used for a variety of tasks and it’s getting more and more popular in statistics and for scientific computing.</p>
<p>Both R and Python have many advantages and features that make them suitable for mathematical applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They are easy to learn and use, with clear and consistent syntax and semantics. They allow you to write concise and elegant code that can handle complex problems, without getting too lost in complicated syntax (have a look at some C or Fortran code for instance).</p></li>
<li><p>They are extensible and modular, supporting multiple paradigms and styles of programming, such as functional, object-oriented, and procedural. For this course, we will be focusing on <strong>functional programming.</strong> This will come later, as it’s the a way of programming that is really close with mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p>They have rich and comprehensive libraries and packages that provide a wide range of functions and tools for various domains and tasks, such as linear algebra, optimization, machine learning, visualization, and web scraping.</p></li>
<li><p>They have interactive and user-friendly environments and interfaces that facilitate development and debugging, such as the console, the editor, and the notebook. We will be using, for this module <strong>R studio.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

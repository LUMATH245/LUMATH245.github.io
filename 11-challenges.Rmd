### Generic FizzBuzz

Imagine R as the 'Ugly Duckling' of programming languages. Initially, it's often misunderstood and overlooked by coding newbies who see it as clunky or uncool. But, thanks to the magic of the `tidyverse`, R has been going through a major glow-up. It's evolving into one of the most elegant and powerful languages out there ðŸ¦¢. To see this, what if I tell you that you can code the above `generic_fizzbuzz` of the exercise in Section \@ref(generic-fizzbuzz) in a very elegant, compact way?

More formally, rewrite `generic_fizzbuzz` respecting the following conditions:

-   Your `generic_fizzbuzz` code should be under 4 statements (lines) and human readable

-   You should not use any brackets `{}`

-   You should avoid for cycles

-   You will probably need the pipe operator `|>` (See intro in Chapter \@ref(data-frames)), and another couple of `purrr` functions (see the cheatsheet, [which you can find here](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/purrr.html)).

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(purrr)
generic_fizzbuzz <- \(x, primes, phrases)
  map2(primes, phrases, \(pr, ph) ifelse(x %% pr == 0, ph, "")) |>
    reduce(paste0) |>
    map2_chr(x, \(r, x) if(nchar(r) == 0) as.character(x) else r)

generic_fizzbuzz(c(1:15, 2 * 3 * 5 * 7), c(2, 3, 5, 7),  c("Skibbidi", "Fizz", "Buzz", "Yo"))
```

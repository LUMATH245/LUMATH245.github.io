# Logic and Vectors {#log_vec}

In this chapter, we will introduce you to the basics of logic in a
computer. Computer Logic is related in its own way to the branch of
mathematical logic, in particular with the branch of Boolean algebra.
And if truth is something elusive in the philosophical discourse, in
Boolean algebra it is well defined, as the $\land, \ \lor, \lnot$ logic
operators are. If you're used to these, for the rest of this chapter, we
will use a different notation for these three symbols: `AND`, `OR` and
`NOT`.

In programming, logic is essential, as it allows us to create and
manipulate expressions and statements that can be evaluated as true or
false. In this way logic enables us to control the flow and structure of
our programs, and to perform various operations and calculations on
data.

## Comparisons

Before we start with the logic, we should cover what *comparison* is. I
mean, we can again phylosofize about it, but pulling out the Oxford
English Dictionary, "[Comparison is ] the action, or an act, of
comparing, likening, or representing as similar: see compare." If we
pull out the definition of *compare,* we simply get "To liken". The
concept of comparison is inherit in human existence, as it's the concept
of what `TRUE` is, (Kierkegaard lost his mind to find out that there's
not a way that two things are the same, that truth is subjective, and
that please do not compare people, that is not nice).

![](images/chapter2/kier.jpeg){width="495"}

Anyway, in programming, comparison is the process of examining two or
more objects or values and determining their relationship or difference.
Comparison can be used for various purposes, such as checking the
validity of an input, showing that two variables contain the same item,
or most importantly to control the flow of a program (later with this).
For now, let's focus on how to compare objects and values in both R and
Python, and how to use the results of comparison in your programs.

First, let's see how to check for equality in R and Python. Equality
means that two objects or values are exactly the same in every aspect.
To check for equality, we use the operator `==`, which returns `TRUE` if
the objects or values are equal, and `FALSE` if they are not. As you
will see, the syntax and the output are very similar in both languages,
except that R uses uppercase letters for `TRUE` and `FALSE`, while
Python uses lowercase letters for `True` and `False`.

For example, we can compare two strings, two integers, or two doubles,
as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Comparing two strings
"Hello" == "Hello"

"Hello" == "hello"


# Comparing two integers
2 == 2

2 == 3


# Comparing two doubles
3.14 == 3.14

3.14 == 3.1415

```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Comparing two strings
"Hello" == "Hello"

"Hello" == "hello"


# Comparing two integers
2 == 2

2 == 3


# Comparing two doubles
3.14 == 3.14

3.14 == 3.1415

```

</div>
:::

From these examples, we can notice how the computer is, indeed, very
strict with the definition of *equality.* Two things might seem similar,
or likely to be the same, but they are not.

Note that the comparison is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and
lowercase letters are considered different. Also note that the
comparison is precise, meaning that even a small difference in the
decimal places can make two doubles unequal. Try adding more decimals to
the above examples, and see how far you can get until you get two same
numbers! The amount of decimal places in doubles *is at the basis of
precision* and how comparisons of doubles are made will affect your
programs. For this reason **be careful when you compare two floats** and
try to avoid equality.

Similar to equality, we can check for inequality. Inequality means that
two objects or values are not exactly the same in every aspect. To check
for inequality, we use the operator `!=`, which returns `TRUE` if the
objects or values are not equal, and `FALSE` if they are. As earlier:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Comparing two strings
"Hello" != "Hello"

"Hello" != "hello"


# Comparing two integers
2 != 2

2 != 3


# Comparing two doubles
3.14 != 3.14

3.14 != 3.1415

```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Comparing two strings
"Hello" != "Hello"

"Hello" != "hello"


# Comparing two integers
2 != 2

2 != 3


# Comparing two doubles
3.14 != 3.14

3.14 != 3.1415

```

</div>
:::

As mentioned above, we can also compare the content of variables. As we
learned last week, a variable is a name that refers to a value or an
object that is stored in the memory, so by comparing variables we
compare the value they refer to. For example, we can assign the string
`"Hello"` to the variable `x` in both languages, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Assigning a string to a variable
x <- "Hello"
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Assigning a string to a variable
x = "Hello"
```

</div>
:::

And we can then use the same operators as before, `==` for equality and
`!=` for inequality. For example, we can compare the variable `x` with
another string, another variable, or itself, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Comparing a variable with a string
x == "Hello"

x == "hello"


# Comparing a variable with another variable
y <- "World"
x == y

y <- "Hello"
x == y


# Comparing a variable with itself
x == x

```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Comparing a variable with a string
x == "Hello"

x == "hello"


# Comparing a variable with another variable
y = "World"
x == y

y = "Hello"
x == y


# Comparing a variable with itself
x == x

```

</div>
:::

In addition to equality and inequality, we can also compare the
magnitude or the order of two values or objects. This is especially
useful in computational maths, as we often need to check if a value is
within a certain range, or if a value satisfies a certain condition. To
compare the magnitude or the order of two values or objects, we use the
following operators:

-   Greater than (`>`): This operator returns `TRUE` if the left operand
    is larger than the right operand, and `FALSE` otherwise. For
    example, `3 > 2` returns `TRUE`, but `2 > 3` returns `FALSE`.
-   Less than (`<`): This operator returns `TRUE` if the left operand is
    smaller than the right operand, and `FALSE` otherwise.
-   Greater than or equal to (`>=`): This operator returns `TRUE` if the
    left operand is larger than or equal to the right operand, and
    `FALSE` otherwise. For example, `3 >= 2` and `3 >= 3` both return
    `TRUE`, but `2 >= 3` returns `FALSE`.
-   Less than or equal to (`<=`): As above, this operator returns `TRUE`
    if the left operand is smaller than or equal to the right operand,
    and `FALSE` otherwise.

Note that the comparison is going to be consistent with the equality and
inequality operators, meaning that if `x == y`, then `x >= y` and
`x <= y` are both `TRUE`, and if `x != y`, then either `x > y` or
`x < y` is `TRUE`.

As an exercise, try to compare two integers, two doubles, or two
variables, as done above, but with the inequality operators, and see the
result.

In the next section, we will introduce you to another important aspect
of logic: logical arithmetic. Logical arithmetic is the process of
combining and manipulating logical values, such as `TRUE` and `FALSE`,
using logical operators, such as `AND` and `OR`. Logical arithmetic can
be used for various purposes, such as creating complex conditions,
testing multiple hypotheses, or performing set operations. In this
section, we will show you how to use logical arithmetic in both R and
Python, and how to use the results of logical arithmetic in your
programs.

## Logical Arithmetic

This might seem easy if you already have a background in logic, but even
if you haven't, the following paragraphs should cover all the necessary
concepts that you will need for programming.

Logical arithmetic is the process of combining and manipulating logical
values, `TRUE` and `FALSE`, which are *logic operands*, using the
*logical operators* `AND` and `OR` or `NOT`.

Let's start from `AND` and `OR`:

-   The `AND` operator returns `TRUE` if both operands are `TRUE`, and
    `FALSE` otherwise.

-   The `OR` operator returns `TRUE` if either or both operands are
    `TRUE`, and `FALSE` otherwise.

We can use the `AND` and `OR` operators to combine two logical values,
such as `TRUE` and `FALSE`, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Using the AND operator
TRUE & TRUE

TRUE & FALSE

FALSE & TRUE

FALSE & FALSE


# Using the OR operator
TRUE | TRUE

TRUE | FALSE

FALSE | TRUE

FALSE | FALSE

```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Using the AND operator
True and True

True and False

False and True

False and False


# Using the OR operator
True or True

True or False

False or True

False or False

```

</div>
:::

As you can see, the syntax and the output are very similar in both
languages, except that R uses `&` and `|` for `AND` and `OR`, while
Python uses `and` and `or`. More formally, we can use a table to show
all the possible outcomes of the `AND` and `OR` operators. Let's say
that $a, \ b$ are our operands, then:

| $a$   | $b$   | $a$ AND $b$ | $a$ OR $b$ |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|
| TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE        | TRUE       |
| TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE       | TRUE       |
| FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE       | TRUE       |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE       | FALSE      |

As you can see, the table has four rows, corresponding to the four
possible combinations of the operands a and b. Again, the table is easy
to build, as it shows a AND b is only TRUE when both a and b are TRUE, a
OR b is only FALSE when both a and b are FALSE.

### Precendence of operators

In logical operations, as in general algebra, the precedence of
operators determines the order in which operations are performed:

1.  **Logical NOT**: This operator has the highest precedence and is
    performed first¹⁴.
2.  **Logical AND**: This operator has the next highest precedence after
    Logical NOT¹⁵.
3.  **Logical OR**: This operator has lower precedence than Logical
    AND¹⁵.

So, in an expression without parentheses, the NOT operation is performed
first, followed by the AND operation, and finally the OR operation.

For example, in the expression `NOT p AND q AND r`, the operations would
be performed in the following order:

1.  `NOT p` is performed first due to the highest precedence of `NOT`.
2.  Then, `(NOTp) AND q` is performed due to the next highest precedence
    of `AND`.
3.  Finally, `((NOT p) AND q) OR r` is performed due to the lowest
    precedence of `OR`.

Parentheses can be used to change this order. For example, in the
expression `p ∧ (q ∨ r)`, the operation `q ∨ r` is performed first due
to the parentheses, even though `∨` has lower precedence than `∧`.

For example, consider the following expression:

`TRUE | TRUE & FALSE`

Without parentheses, in this expression the `AND` operator has higher
precedence than the `OR` operator, so it is evaluated first. The result
is then combined with the `OR` operator. The expression is equivalent
to:

`TRUE | (TRUE & FALSE)`

However, if we use parentheses to group the operands differently, we can
change the order of evaluation and the result of the expression. If we
use parentheses to group the first and the last operands, we get:

`(TRUE | TRUE) & FALSE`

The value of this expression is in fact `FALSE`. Now, the `OR` operator
is evaluated first, giving `TRUE` and the result is then combined with
the `AND` operator, giving `FALSE`.

#### Exercise

To test your understanding of logical arithmetic, try to find what is
the value of:

-   `TRUE | TRUE & FALSE`?
-   `FALSE | FALSE & TRUE`?
-   `(TRUE & FALSE) | (FALSE & TRUE)`?
-   `(TRUE | TRUE) & FALSE`?
-   `(TRUE | FALSE) & (FALSE | TRUE)`?

You should use the console in R or Python to check your answers. You can
review the table and the examples above, and try to understand the logic
behind each expression.

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Checking the answers
TRUE | TRUE & FALSE
FALSE | FALSE & TRUE
(TRUE & FALSE) | (FALSE & TRUE)
(TRUE | TRUE) & FALSE
(TRUE | FALSE) & (FALSE | TRUE)
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Checking the answers
True and False or True
False or False and True
(True and False) or (False and True)
True and (False or True)
(True or False) and (False or True)
```

</div>

## Flow

Another important aspect of logic is flow. Flow is the order and
direction in which the instructions of a program are executed **and is
at the base of an algorithm**.

Normally, a computer program, has a start, it will do something, and
then terminate (return an output). This is called the *flow* of a
program. Now, of course, to control the flow, you need a mechanism that
checks on the state of your program, and performs an action based on the
state in which you are. Surprisingly enough, we run programs in every
day tasks too. When driving down from Glasgow to London, we need to
check where we are, and turn the steering wheel accordingly in such a
way that our car points towards South. When doing the laundry in a
laundrette, we first check the amounts of money we have, and then, if we
have enough, load up the washing machine, if we don't, well, we need to
get some more. Or say, for example, that you need to code something,
maybe for an assignment :) What you might end up doing, is the
following:

![](images/chapter2/code_something.png)

**I have to remark that this was a joke:** remember that if you cheat at
this stage with programming you are just cheating yourself.

More formally, in computer programs, flow can be controlled by using
*conditional statements*, such as if - else if - else. Conditional
statements allow us to execute different blocks of code depending on the
result of a logical expression or condition. For example, we can use
conditional statements to perform different actions based on the value
of a variable, the input of the user, or the outcome of a calculation.

### The if-then-else statement

The simplest form of a conditional statement is the if statement. The if
statement checks a single condition, and executes a block of code if the
condition is true. For example, we can use an if statement to print a
message if a variable is positive, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Assigning a value to a variable
x <- 10

# Using an if statement
if (x > 0) {
  print("x is positive")
}
# x is positive
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Assigning a value to a variable
x = 10

# Using an if statement
if x > 0:
  print("x is positive")
# x is positive
```

</div>
:::

Concerning syntax, e.g. the way we write the code:

-   To enclose the condition that is checked by the if statement, e.g.
    where your logic expression goes (e.g. the block of code that
    evaluates either to `TRUE` or `FALSE):`

    -   R uses an `if` followed by parentheses `()`, where the condition
        goes

    -   Python has no parentheses, but has a `:` symbol to indicate that
        the condition has ended and the block of code to execute has
        started

-   To denote the block of code to execute if the condition is true:

    -   R uses curly braces `{}` to enclose the block of code that is
        executed if the condition is true. All code that is relative to
        the if condition needs to be within these brackets

    -   Python, uses indentation to delimit the block of execution. All
        code that needs to execute needs to be indented at the same
        level. Indentation in Python is achieved either with a tab
        (recommended), or with 4 spaces.

Note that the if statement only executes the block of code if the
condition is true, and does nothing otherwise. This means, that if the
condition is `FALSE`, the program will simply skip the code within the
block, as if it never existed.

Sometimes, we may want to check more than one condition, and execute
different blocks of code for each condition. For this, we can use the
if - else if - else statement. The if - else if - else statement checks
multiple conditions in order, and executes the first block of code that
corresponds to a true condition. If none of the conditions are true, the
else block of code is executed. For example, we can use an if - else
if - else statement to print a message based on the sign of a variable,
as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Assigning a value to a variable
x <- 10

# Using an if - else if - else statement
if (x < 0) {
  print("x is negative")
} else if (x == 0) {
  print("x is zero")
} else {
  print("x is positive")
}
# x is positive
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Assigning a value to a variable
x = 10

# Using an if - else if - else statement
if x < 0:
  print("x is negative")
elif x == 0:
  print("x is zero")
else:
  print("x is positive")
# x is positive
```

</div>
:::

As you can see, the syntax is very similar again in both languages,
except that R uses `else if` and Python uses `elif` for the second
condition. Note that the order of the conditions is important, as only
the first condition that is true is executed. If none of the conditions
are true, the else block is executed.

Sometimes, we may want to check two or more independent conditions, and
execute different blocks of code for each condition. For this, we can
use two or more if statements one after another. This is different from
using an if - else if - else statement, as each if statement is
evaluated separately, and more than one block of code can be executed.
For example, we can use two if statements to print a message based on
the divisibility of a variable by 2 and 3, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Assigning a value to a variable
n <- 12

# Using two if statements
if (n %% 2 == 0) {
  print("n is divisible by 2")
}
if (n %% 3 == 0) {
  print("n is divisible by 3")
}
# n is divisible by 2
# n is divisible by 3
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Assigning a value to a variable
n = 12

# Using two if statements
if n % 2 == 0:
  print("n is divisible by 2")
if n % 3 == 0:
  print("n is divisible by 3")
# n is divisible by 2
# n is divisible by 3
```

</div>
:::

As you can see, the syntax and the output are very similar in both
languages, except that R uses `%%` for the modulo operator, while Python
uses `%`. Note that both if statements are executed, as both conditions
are true. If we used an if - else if - else statement instead, only the
first condition would be executed, and the second condition would be
ignored.

### Nesting if-statements

Sometimes, we may want to check a condition within another condition,
and execute different blocks of code for each combination. For this, we
can use a nested if statement. A nested if statement is an if statement
inside another if statement. A nested if statement can have multiple
levels of nesting, and can also include else if and else blocks. For
example, we can use a nested if statement to print a message based on
the value and the sign of a variable, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Assigning a value to a variable
x <- -10

# Using a nested if statement
if (x > 0) {
  if (x > 10) {
    print("x is positive and greater than 10")
  } else {
    print("x is positive and less than or equal to 10")
  }
} else {
  if (x < -10) {
    print("x is negative and less than -10")
  } else {
    print("x is negative and greater than or equal to -10")
  }
}
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Assigning a value to a variable
x = -10

# Using a nested if statement
if x > 0:
  if x > 10:
    print("x is positive and greater than 10")
  else:
    print("x is positive and less than or equal to 10")
else:
  if x < -10:
    print("x is negative and less than -10")
  else:
    print("x is negative and greater than or equal to -10")
```

</div>
:::

Concerning syntax, you can now see the double indentation in the python
code. The nested if statement checks the outer condition first (x being
positive), and then checks the inner condition if the outer condition is
true (x being greater then 10). Note also that the nested if statement
can have multiple levels of nesting, and can also include else if and
else blocks.

In the next section, we will introduce you to a fun and popular game
that involves logic and flow: FizzBuzz.

### FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a game that tests your ability to use logic and flow in
programming. The rules of the game are simple: given a number, print
"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, print "Buzz" if the number is
divisible by 5, print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3
and 5, and print the number itself otherwise. For example, given the
number 15, print "FizzBuzz", given the number 9, print "Fizz", given the
number 10, print "Buzz", and given the number 7, print 7.

To play FizzBuzz in R or Python, we can use a variable to store the
number, and then use an if - else if - else statement to check the
conditions and print the output, as shown below:


::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Assigning a value to a variable
n <- 15

# Playing FizzBuzz
if (n %% 3 == 0 & n %% 5 == 0) {
  print("FizzBuzz")
} else if (n %% 3 == 0) {
  print("Fizz")
} else if (n %% 5 == 0) {
  print("Buzz")
} else {
  print(n)
}
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Assigning a value to a variable
n = 15

# Playing FizzBuzz
if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
  print("FizzBuzz")
elif n % 3 == 0:
  print("Fizz")
elif n % 5 == 0:
  print("Buzz")
else:
  print(n)
```

</div>
:::


The Fizzbuzz condition uses the modulo `%%` (`%` in Python) operator. This, recall,
returns the remainder of the division. The logical and operator
returns true if both operands are true. Note also that the order of the
conditions is important, as we need to check the divisibility by both 3
and 5 first, and then we check the divisibility by 3 or 5 separately.

To see how FizzBuzz works, try to replace the value of the
variable `n` with different numbers, and see what the output is. For
example, try `n <- 45` in R, or `n = 45` in Python, and see what
happens!

#### Exercise: Skibbidifizzbuzz

As an exercise, try to write a variation of FizzBuzz, called
Skibbidifizzbuzz, where the rules are the same as above, but now you
have to add "Skibbidi" if the number is divisible by 2. For example,
given the number 12, print "SkibbidiFizz", given the number 20, print
"SkibbidiBuzz", given the number 30, print "SkibbidiFizzBuzz", and given
the number 8, print "Skibbidi".


## Vectors

We now introduce the first (and the most fundamental!) data structures in programming: vectors. Vectors, as in maths, are ordered collections of values that can be manipulated as a single unit. All elements in a vector need to be homogeneous, e.g. of the same type, for example we cannot have a vector with a string and an integer together. Later on, when we will introduce matrices, we will find out that these are nothing but a collection of vectors (vectors of vectors).
And we, in maths, know how powerful linear algebra is: through vectors, we can store, process, and analyze large amounts of numerical data efficiently and elegantly.

### Creating vectors
We will now see how to create and use vectors in R and Python, and how to perform element wise operations on vectors.

To create a vector in R, we use the `c` function, which stands for concatenate. The `c` function takes one or more values as arguments, and returns a vector that contains those values. For example, we can create a vector that contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, as shown below:

```{r}
# Creating a vector in R
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x
# 1 2 3
```

To create a vector in Python, we use the `array` function from the `numpy` module, which stands for numerical Python. While technically the Python array is not the same of an R vector (as you can have arrays of arrays, which is a similar structure to a matrix), we will use the Python array interchangeably for now, as they behave very similar and they fulfill similar roles.
The first thing to use arrays in python, is to import the `numpy` array. The `numpy` module is a library that provides various tools and functions for working with numerical data and scientific computing. The `array` function takes a list as an argument, and returns an array that contains the elements of the list. A list, in Python, is another, built-in structure to represent and ordered set of data, but it comes from the original python, was designed with different aims, and comes with a lot less powers then the numpy `array`. So for now, please stick to the following when you create vectors in python.
We can create an array that contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, as shown below:

```{python}
# Importing the numpy module
import numpy as np

# This is a simple python list
[1, 2, 3]

# Creating an array in Python
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
x
```

Note that we need to import the `numpy` library before using the `array` function, and we use the alias `np` to refer to the module. Therefore, before we proceed it is probably a good time to introduce what a library is. 

#### Libraries
A library is a collection of code that provides predefined functions, classes, variables, and other resources that can be used by other programs. Libraries can save time and effort by allowing programmers to reuse existing code and avoid writing everything from scratch. Libraries can also enhance the functionality and the performance of a programming language by offering specialized tools and features that are not built-in.

For example, the numpy library is a library that provides various tools and functions for working with numerical data and scientific computing. The numpy library is not part of the standard Python language, but it can be installed and imported by using the import statement. The import statement tells Python to load the library and make it available for use. The import statement can also assign an alias or a nickname to the library, such as np, to make it easier to refer to the library in the code.

Normally, one has to reference import numpy as np only at the beginning of the script, before using any of the functions or resources from the numpy library:

```{python}
# Importing the numpy library and assigning an alias
import numpy as np

#     rest of your script!    #
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ # 
```
This way, Python knows where to find the functions that is needed, and the programmer does not have to repeat the import statement every time.

R has libraries too, those are imported via the command `library`, but we will see how to use these at a later time as R has already plenty of scientific computing functions and structures built in.

#### Creating sequences

One of the common ways to create vectors or arrays is to use sequences. Sequences are ordered collections of values that follow a certain pattern or rule. Sequences can be useful for generating data, plotting, or creating loops, as we will see later on.
As you will see, here the syntax is going to be a bit different in each language, as R uses functions such `:` or `seq` and Python uses `np.arange` or `np.linspace` to create and initialize vectors. We will see how to create sequences of integers, any sequence of equally spaced numbers, and finally, how to initialize an empty vectors with all same values. 

**To create a sequence of integers in R**, we can use the colon operator `:`, in Python, we can use the `arange` function from `numpy`. Both take two integers as arguments, and returns a vector or an array that contains all the integers from the first argument to the second argument, with a step size of 1. For example, we can create a sequence of integers from -5 to 10, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Creating a sequence of integers from -5 to 10
x <- -5:10
x
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Importing the numpy module
import numpy as np

# Creating a sequence of integers from -5 to 10
x = np.arange(-5, 11)
x
```

</div>
:::

**To create any sequence**, we can use the `seq` function in R, and the `arange` or `linspace` functions in Python. For example, we can create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a step size of 0.1, or with a length of 11, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

The `seq` function in R can take named arguments, such as `from`, `to`, `by`, or `length.out`, to specify the parameters of the sequence. 
```{r}
# Creating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a step size of 0.1
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)
x

# Creating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a length of 11
y <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 11)
y
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

The `np.arange` function in Python, with an additional argument, will indicate the step size. In this case, arange, requires the second argument to be one step more than the desired end point of the sequence. The `np.linspace` function, instead, will create a vector of a desired length (11 elements) of equally spaced elements. It requires the third argument to be the desired length of the sequence.
```{python}
# Importing the numpy module
import numpy as np

# Creating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a step size of 0.1
x = np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1)
x

# Creating a sequence of numbers from 0 to 1, with a length of 11
y = np.linspace(0, 1, 11)
y
```

</div>
:::

**Empty vectors.** Lastly, there might be some cases where we have to create an empty vector or array in R and Python. An empty vector or array can be useful for initializing a vector or array that will be filled with values later, as we will see in the next chapters. For this, we can use the `vector` or `array` function, respectively, and specify the type and the length of the vector or array. An empty vector or array is a vector or array that contains no values, but has a predefined type and length. For example, we can create an empty vector or array of type numeric and length 5, as shown below:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Creating an empty vector of type numeric and length 5
x <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = 5)
x
# 0 0 0 0 0
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Importing the numpy module
import numpy as np

# Creating an empty array of type numeric and length 5
x = np.empty(5, dtype = "float")
x
# array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])
```

</div>
:::

As you can see, the syntax and the output are different in both languages, as R uses `vector` and Python uses `np.empty` to access the functions from the `numpy` module. Note that the `vector` function in R takes the `mode` argument to specify the type of the vector, and the `length` argument to specify the length of the vector. Note also that the `np.empty` function in Python takes the `dtype` argument to specify the type of the array, and the length of the array as the first argument.

### Modifying vectors

One of the main advantages of using vectors or arrays is that we can perform elementwise operations on them. Elementwise operations are operations that are applied to each element of the vector or the array individually, and return a new vector or array that contains the results. Elementwise operations preserve the shape and the length of the vector or the array, meaning that the resulting vector or array has the same number of elements as the original vector or array.

For example, we can add, subtract, multiply, or divide a vector or an array by a scalar (which is a single value):

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Adding a scalar to a vector
x + 1
# 2 3 4

# Subtracting a scalar from a vector
x - 1
# 0 1 2

# Multiplying a vector by a scalar
x * 2
# 2 4 6

# Dividing a vector by a scalar
x / 2
# 0.5 1.0 1.5
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Adding a scalar to an array
x + 1
# array([2, 3, 4])

# Subtracting a scalar from an array
x - 1
# array([0, 1, 2])

# Multiplying an array by a scalar
x * 2
# array([2, 4, 6])

# Dividing an array by a scalar
x / 2
# array([0.5, 1. , 1.5])
```

</div>
:::

Note that the element wise operations are performed by using the same arithmetic operators as before, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

#### Functions and algebra with vectors

But we can do more! One of the benefits of using vectors or arrays is that we can apply a whole function, such as `sin(.)` or `log(.)`, on the entire vector elementwise. This means that the function is applied to each element of the vector individually, and returns a new vector that contains the results. For example, let's apply the `sin(.)` function, which calculates the sine of an angle in radians, on a vector that contains the angles $0$, $\pi/2$, $\pi$, and $3 \pi/2$:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Creating a vector of angles in radians
x <- c(0, pi/2, pi, 3*pi/2)
x

# Applying the sin function on the vector elementwise
sin(x)
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Creating an array of angles in radians
x = np.array([0, np.pi/2, np.pi, 3*np.pi/2])
x

# Applying the sin function on the array elementwise
np.sin(x)
```

</div>
:::

The function is applied to each element of the vector or the array individually, and returns a new vector or array that contains the results. Note also that by default the results are in scientific notation.

We can also apply many other functions! Go back to last week introduction and see how many of the functions we introduced already, such as `log()`, run elementwise on vectors.

And as we can sum two scalars, another benefit of using vectors or arrays is that we can do elementwise product and sum of two vectors. If two vectors or arrays are the same length, this will return a new vector or array that contains the elementwise results of your desired operation:

::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}
<div>

**R**

```{r}
# Creating two vectors of the same length
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)

# Doing elementwise product of two vectors
x * y

# Doing elementwise sum of two vectors
x + y
```

</div>

<div>

**python**

```{python}
# Creating two arrays of the same length
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
y = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])

# Doing elementwise product of two arrays
x * y
# array([ 5, 12, 21, 32])

# Doing elementwise sum of two arrays
x + y
# array([ 6,  8, 10, 12])
```

</div>
:::

As you can see, the syntax and the output are very similar in both languages, except that Python uses `np.array` to access the function from the `numpy` module. Note that the elementwise product and sum are performed by using the same arithmetic operators as before, such as `*` and `+`. Note also that the elementwise product and sum preserve the shape and the length of the vectors or the arrays, meaning that the resulting vector or array has the same number of elements as the input vectors or arrays.

#### Doing the dot product of two vectors

Lastly, one important operation that we can do with vectors or arrays is the dot product, and this will be super useful to you in the future as you will deal with applications in linear algebra, geometry, and machine learning. Recall that the dot product takes two vectors or arrays of the same length, and returns a single number that is the sum of the elementwise products of the vectors or arrays. For example, the dot product of the vectors `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[5, 6, 7, 8]` is `1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 4*8 = 70`.

To calculate the dot product of two vectors or arrays in R and Python, we use the following functions:

- In R, we use the `%*%` operator, which performs matrix multiplication. If the input vectors are one-dimensional, the matrix multiplication is equivalent to the dot product. For example, we can calculate the dot product of two vectors, as shown below:

```{r}
# Creating two vectors of the same length
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)

# Doing the dot product of two vectors
x %*% y
```

- In Python, we use the `dot` function from the `numpy` module, which performs the dot product of two arrays. For example, we can calculate the dot product of two arrays, as shown below:

```{python}
# Creating two arrays of the same length
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
y = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])

# Doing the dot product of two arrays
np.dot(x, y)
```

As you can see, the syntax and the output are different in both languages, as R uses a special operator and Python uses a function from `numpy`. Note also that the dot product requires the input vectors or arrays to have the same length, otherwise it will produce an error.

We will cover how to do algebra with Python and R in the future chapters.
